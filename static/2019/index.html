  <p><strong>Welcome to <em>The Ringer</em></strong><strong>’s 2019 NFL Draft Guide</strong><strong>.</strong> Consider this your hub for all things draft-related leading up to the first round on April 25. It’ll include prospect rankings, scouting reports, mock drafts, and much more&mdash;and best of all, we will be updating it regularly with new analysis that takes all of the latest developments into account.<br></p>
<p>At launch, the guide featured Danny Kelly’s Big Board, highlighting the 32 players he was highest on coming out of college football season. That list soon expanded, and we unveiled the first of many mock drafts. On the heels of the combine, we rolled out thorough scouting evaluations of every prized prospect. And in April we added breakdowns of team needs from Robert Mays to make sense of the league landscape after a flurry of free-agent moves. Click through all the tabs to get the full breadth of our analysis.</p>
<p>Who will the Cardinals take at no. 1? Whose stock will rise and fall? Which future All-Pros are flying under the radar? Check back often to see where things stand. Draft season is officially on the clock.</p>

        <strong>Scouting Report</strong>
        <p>Jones has the physical makeup to develop into a pro passer, with prototypical size, top-tier athleticism, and a good arm. He is a three-year starter who learned under former Eli and Peyton Manning tutor David Cutcliffe at Duke, and playing in an RPO-heavy offense, he displayed the ability to go through reads and throw with accuracy at the short and intermediate levels. Jones is very athletic, capable of running away from defenders if he finds some daylight, and rushed for 17 touchdowns in his college career. He struggled to throw with anticipation at times, though, and was scattershot with his deep accuracy, finishing with a 69.0 passer rating on deep passes in 2018, per Pro Football Focus, which ranked seventh worst of 50 qualifying quarterbacks in this class. Jones’s receivers dropped an incredible amount of passes, but his college statistics do not paint the picture of a future NFL starter: He finished his career averaging just 6.4 yards per attempt with a 60 percent completion rate and 29 interceptions to go along with his 52 touchdowns. He displayed questionable decision-making, launching throws from off-balance platforms or forcing passes into coverage, and struggled under pressure.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Rise</strong>
        <p>Jones has the type of moldable traits that NFL teams are looking for; with good size, arm strength, and short and intermediate accuracy, he has the potential to eventually develop into a starter-caliber NFL passer.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Fall</strong>
        <p>He displays questionable decision-making, throws far too many interceptions, and was very inaccurate on deep passes.</p>

<div class="player-info">

        <div class="deep-dives">        
        <strong>Scouting Report</strong>
        <p>Winovich has a rock-solid frame and a quick first step. He springs out of his stance to attack upfield, using active hands and his revved-up motor to threaten the edge and pursue the quarterback to the whistle. He has good bend to dip and rip around the corner. He plays with a feisty, aggressive persona but can get out of control at times; he occasionally leans too far forward in his rush, allowing savvy tackles to throw him to the ground. Winovich is a very good run defender and a reliable, forceful tackler&mdash;but he can lose sight of the ballcarrier as he’s trying to make his way upfield. He’s a good athlete with plenty of agility, as illustrated by the elite 1.55 10-yard split he posted in his combine 40-yard dash and his 6.94-second three-cone time.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Rise</strong>
        <p>Winovich is a disruptive, rugged edge defender with a three-down skill set and a motor that always runs hot.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Fall</strong>
        <p>He’s aggressive to the point of recklessness, too often playing out over his skis as he shoots forward at the snap; he lacks the prototypical length.</p>

        <strong>Scouting Report</strong>
        <p>Howard is a former high school quarterback and walk-on to Alabama State who started out at tight end before transitioning to offensive line. He has a massive frame with a powerful base, long arms, and meat hooks for hands, and boasts basketball athleticism. He logged starts for the Hornets at both right and left tackle, using good bend and light feet to mirror pass rushers on the edge. He’s still raw at the position and is inconsistent when it comes to landing his punch, but when he can get his hands on an opponent, he plays with leverage and torque to control the rush. He’s got the size, power, and footwork to generate movement in the run game. Howard is still growing into the position, but has all the traits that offensive line coaches are looking for.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Rise</strong>
        <p>Howard has the size, length, and feet to develop into a quality tackle.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Fall</strong>
        <p>He not only has to continue to learn the nuances of the position, but must now deal with NFL speed after playing at a lower level of competition at Alabama State.</p>

        <strong>Scouting Report</strong>
        <p>Scharping is an athletic tackle with good height and a well-proportioned frame, wearing his 327 pounds like a man 30 pounds lighter. He has experience at right tackle and right guard, and started at left tackle the past two seasons. Scharping glides in pass protection and covers ground while working as a blocker in space. He keeps his punch inside and has strong hands. He leans back at times at the start of his set and will mistime his punch, but when he latches on to his opponent, he can generate torque in his upper body to control his opponent. In the run game, Scharping gives good effort and does well to effectively wall off defenders, but is not a road grader at the point of attack.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Rise</strong>
        <p>Scharping is a steadfast and reliable pass protector who brings plenty of grit in the ground game and the ability to play multiple positions on the line.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Fall</strong>
        <p>He played at a lower level of competition, needs refinement in his technique, and could improve as a run blocker.</p>

        <strong>Scouting Report</strong>
        <p>Nelson is an athletic strongside end with rare length and loads of untapped upside. The former Hawkeyes defender isn’t super twitched up but has very good functional strength and lateral agility. He uses a deadly long-arm stab move early in his rush to get offensive linemen on their heels, and flashes an effective push-pull-rip move as a counter. He can bend at the last second to finish his rush, and posted strong numbers in 2018, racking up 9.5 sacks. Per Pro Football Focus, he notched <a href="https://twitter.com/PFF_College/status/1114561657496326144">53 pressures</a>&nbsp;on the year&mdash;tied for tops among Big Ten edge rushers&mdash;and his 23.5 percent pass-rush win rate was also first in the conference. Against the run, Nelson stacks blockers while keeping eyes in the backfield, then shakes his opponent to tackle the ballcarrier.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Rise</strong>
        <p>Nelson has rare length to go with versatility, consistency, athleticism, and production.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Fall</strong>
        <p>He lacks top-tier speed, explosion, and bend; will need to prove he can shoot gaps as an interior pass rusher.</p>

        <strong>Scouting Report</strong>
        <p>Boykin is a supreme athlete with the combination of size, physicality, and athleticism to develop into <a href="https://www.thefantasyfootballers.com/articles/reception-perception-miles-boykin-has-the-release-moves-size-to-bring-back-the-x-receiver-spotlight/">a prototypical X receiver</a>. The former Notre Dame standout is sudden off the line and has no trouble beating press coverage to get downfield. He has long-striding speed downfield, shows awareness of the sideline on catches, and is adept at using his size and positioning to draw pass interference penalties. He’s a strong route runner who doesn’t betray his intentions before making his cut and has very good hands, regularly plucking the ball away from his frame. He can contort in the air to <a href="https://twitter.com/PFF_Steve/status/1110593509709496322">bring down an off-target pass</a>.&nbsp;In the run game, he’s an aggressive blocker who sticks with his assignment all the way through the whistle.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Rise</strong>
        <p>Boykin is an elite athlete with big frame who’s just scratching the surface of his potential.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Fall</strong>
        <p>He didn’t post gaudy numbers and needs to be more consistently aggressive at the catch point.</p>

        <strong>Scouting Report</strong>
        <p>Hall boasts elite downfield speed; the former Tiger is an electric deep threat who averaged 23.6 yards per catch over the past two seasons. He has excellent foot quickness and uses jukes, head fakes, and his hands to discard press coverage and push downfield. Against off-coverage, he eats up a cornerback’s cushion in a hurry and often runs right past his defender. Hall is agile after the catch, able to make defenders miss and pick up extra yards. He could stand to be more aggressive at the catch point, too often waiting for the ball instead of attacking it. He’s not much help as a blocker and may need to take his play demeanor up a notch or three in the NFL. He’s best paired with a signal-caller who’s not afraid to unleash passes deep and who throws with anticipation.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Rise</strong>
        <p>Hall has the take-the-top-off-a-defense speed that teams will have to account for on every snap.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Fall</strong>
        <p>He struggled with drops at times and is still raw as a route runner.</p>

        <strong>Scouting Report</strong>
        <p>Grier is a smooth, confident passer who loves to attack defenses deep. He has a good arm (his ball velocity <a href="https://twitter.com/dpbrugler/status/1109078742784270336">clocked in at 59 mph at the combine</a>,&nbsp;tied for best in the class) and exhibits top-tier accuracy and touch in the vertical passing game. He racked up the most pass attempts and completions <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oMnndoxbS8">of 20-plus yards</a>&nbsp;in college football the last two seasons combined, per Pro Football Focus. The former Mountaineers signal-caller is very accurate in the intermediate passing attack, too, and is most dangerous when he drops back and throws on time. But when he’s forced to move off his spot or improvise, his footwork, accuracy, decision-making, and pass velocity all erode; he often tries to do too much, throws off-balance, or forces it into coverage in those situations. Grier plays mostly out of shotgun looks in West Virginia's Air Raid–style offense.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Rise</strong>
        <p>Grier is an aggressive and accurate deep-ball passer with the upside to develop into a starter in a vertical-oriented offense.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Fall</strong>
        <p>He struggles under pressure or when moved off his spot. Is slightly undersized, and some teams may see backup potential only.</p>

        <div class="deep-dives">        
        <strong>Scouting Report</strong>
        <p>Long is a fiery and physical press cornerback. He jabs and spars with receivers at the snap before transitioning smoothly, strafing laterally or flipping his hips to match steps with his opponent. He shows easy confidence in coverage, maintains subtle contact with the receiver throughout the route, and was rarely targeted in 2018. Long displays the ability to mirror and trail receivers from the slot, and while he may lack elite long-speed deep, he’s almost never beaten by quickness. He could have a future in the slot but may need to be more subtle with his hand-fighting at the next level to avoid penalties.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Rise</strong>
        <p>Long sticks to receivers like glue while playing an aggressive and physical brand of coverage.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Fall</strong>
        <p>He lacks length, with just 30.75-inch arms, and has a slight frame; he rarely played off coverage and may need time to adjust to other scheme techniques.</p>

        <strong>Scouting Report</strong>
        <p>Isabella has a compact, muscled frame and boasts track speed. He’s quick off the line, and while some teams may see him as a slot receiver only, he played all over the field for UMass and was a dangerous downfield threat who tied for the national lead with <a href="http://www.cfbstats.com/2018/leader/national/player/split01/category35/sort04.html">11 receptions of 40-plus yards</a>.&nbsp;Isabella has impressive acceleration off the line, can change direction on a dime, and is elusive after the catch, creating yards for himself on screens. He shows excellent awareness on catches near the sideline to keep his feet inbounds, and because corners respect his deep speed, he’s good on comeback routes and hitches. He had some trouble with drops, will need to avoid body-catching at the next level, and has a small catch radius.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Rise</strong>
        <p>Isabella pairs elite deep speed and human-joystick-like agility in the short and intermediate zones; he was wildly productive in college.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Fall</strong>
        <p>His small frame could cause durability concerns and some teams may see him as a slot receiver only.</p>

        <div class="deep-dives">        
        <strong>Scouting Report</strong>
        <p>Allen is an athletic defensive end with massive size and an intimidating on-field demeanor. If you squint, the former Boston College standout looks a little like J.J. Watt; he’s not nearly as explosive as the three-time Defensive Player of the Year but does possess good first-step burst, pack plenty of power in his hands, and know how to use his length as leverage. Allen has to win early in his rush or he can get stalemated, and, while he’s not consistently going to threaten the edge against pro tackles, he showed he can get to the quarterback with a repertoire of block-beating moves, including a strong swim move and powerful club-rip. He’s a dominant run defender and has notched 40.5 tackles for a loss in the past three seasons. His massive wingspan gives him a wide tackle radius and helps him stack linemen and shed blocks. He knocked down seven passes and blocked two kicks in 2018. He projects as a strongside defensive end in a 4-3 or 5-technique in a 3-4.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Rise</strong>
        <p>Allen combines size, athleticism, positional versatility, and power; he should be a high-floor contributor to any line.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Fall</strong>
        <p>He lacks explosiveness as a pass rusher and struggles to bend and change directions.</p>

        <strong>Scouting Report</strong>
        <p>Henderson is a speedy, elusive, and astoundingly productive back who averaged 8.9 yards per carry over the past two seasons while racking up 3,584 scrimmage yards and 36 touchdowns along the way. The AP first-team All-American can deliver some pop, has good contact balance to break through arm tackle attempts, and led the draft class in <a href="https://twitter.com/ScottBarrettDFB/status/1110972149299335168">yards after contact per carry</a>, per Pro Football Focus. He’s a slashing, slalom-style runner who seeks daylight and often finds it. He’s explosive in the open field and quickly gets up to top speed when he sees even a sliver of daylight. The former Tiger led the country in runs of both <a href="http://www.cfbstats.com/2018/leader/national/player/split01/category31/sort02.html">20-plus yards (27)</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.cfbstats.com/2018/leader/national/player/split01/category31/sort02.html">40-plus yards (12)</a>&nbsp;in 2018. He sets up his blocks at the second level, peeking one way to get a defender to commit before cutting the other direction to break free. Henderson was frequently deployed taking direct snaps in wildcat looks and has upside as a pass-catching threat with 63 receptions and eight touchdowns in his college career. He’s not the most laterally elusive back and won’t make many defenders miss behind the line of scrimmage.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Rise</strong>
        <p>Henderson can create explosive plays from anywhere on the field and should be a factor in the passing attack.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Fall</strong>
        <p>He lacks size, and some teams may see him as best suited for a complementary role.</p>

  How Did We Get <br/>Here with <b>Kyler <br/>Murray?</b>

</div>
<div class="content">
<p><strong>I cannot believe that we’ve gotten to this point with Kyler Murray.</strong> I’d already given up on the idea of ever seeing him play football again. His lone season as Oklahoma’s starting quarterback was one of the greatest introductions to the sport that a player has ever made, and it also felt like one of the great farewell tours. It’s rare and beautiful for a first-year starter to win the Heisman Trophy; it’s rarer and more poignant for that guy to be someone who has already committed to a career in another sport. The Oakland A’s nabbed Murray ninth overall in the 2018 MLB draft, guaranteeing him millions of dollars to give up life as an undersized QB to become one of the centerpieces of the franchise’s outfield plan. Murray’s future was set.</p>
<p>Until he made clear that he is better at playing quarterback than he ever will be at anything else, that is. Murray just put together the second-most efficient passing season in college football history, and was even more impressive as a runner. I’ve never seen anybody else change directions at high speeds the way he does. I cannot stress this enough: In baseball, players almost never change directions. They are required, by rule, to run counterclockwise around a diamond. Football is the sport for Kyler.</p>
<p>For the life of me, I’ll never understand why the A’s drafted Murray and then let him play football for the Sooners. They ran the risk of injury, for one, and also the risk of this&mdash;Murray emerging as a superstar in the other sport and never coming back to baseball. The A’s let Murray realize his football destiny. Even if he doesn’t pan out in the NFL, I’ll be forever grateful for their mistake. </p>

        <strong>Scouting Report</strong>
        <p>Cashman is a compact, athletic linebacker prospect with good play speed, range in coverage, and excellent production. The former Gopher attacks the run with fury, sifting through the trash to get himself into position and taking on blocks with ferocious attitude. He’s quick to react and can slip off blocks to make tackles. He is strong coming downhill and racked up 15.0 tackles for a loss and 2.5 sacks in 2018. He struggled at times with identifying misdirection. While he lacks length, he makes up for it in fundamental tackling technique. In coverage, he shows awareness in zones and the instincts to read route combinations but may be overmatched against bigger, longer tight ends in man coverage down the seam. He has the athleticism to carry running backs out of the backfield.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Rise</strong>
        <p>Cashman has outstanding sideline-to-sideline speed and is an extremely reliable tackler.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Fall</strong>
        <p>He’s slightly undersized and may be limited to playing on the weak side in the NFL.</p>

        <strong>Scouting Report</strong>
        <p>Wren is a massive, muscled-up defensive lineman with an explosive first step and a shocking punch. He fires out of his stance at the snap to knock offensive linemen back into the pocket, but his sack production was disappointing as he lined up primarily at the nose tackle spot. Technique-wise, he is more of a bull in a china shop than a disciplined, fundamental rusher at this point in his career. When his initial surge is stopped, he often pops upright, loses his leverage, and gets washed out of the play or knocked off his feet. His draft stock is connected to where teams project him at the next level: Because of his top-tier athleticism, he has a high floor as a penetrating, gap-shooting three-technique defensive tackle, where his quick-twitch burst and power can be better utilized.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Rise</strong>
        <p>Wren has elite athletic traits, massive size, and plenty of length.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Fall</strong>
        <p>He lacked in production, grabbing just 3.0 career sacks, and needs work on his pass-rushing technique.</p>

        <strong>Scouting Report</strong>
        <p>Pratt is an athletic, versatile linebacker who is a consistent and reliable tackler and an excellent blitzer. He showed a nose for the ball for the Wolfpack, racking up 104 tackles&mdash;including 10 for a loss&mdash;plus three passes defensed and two forced fumbles in 2018. The former safety understands how routes develop in coverage and showed off excellent effective range and a smooth transition to trailing position to carry running backs or tight ends downfield. When lined up over the slot, he is physical at the line of scrimmage, jamming and rerouting pass catchers. He can slice through the line and finish as a blitzer, and notched 6.0 sacks last season. He has very good closing burst and tackle radius and the potential to play inside or outside in both 3-4 and 4-3 schemes. He takes on blocks with a far-too-upright technique, though, leaving him susceptible to getting knocked back or sealed out of the play too easily. He’s still raw at the position, and there may be a learning curve in the transition to the pros.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Rise</strong>
        <p>Pratt is strong against the run and smooth in coverage, and he offers tantalizing upside as a dynamic blitzer and situational pass rusher.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Fall</strong>
        <p>His block-shedding technique needs work, and he’s still learning the intricacies of the position.</p>

        <strong>Scouting Report</strong>
        <p>Harris is a tough, physical back with good size and a thick, muscular build. He lacks explosiveness and top-tier change-of-direction skills but picks up yards with a combination of vision, burst, quick feet, and an innate feel for his blocks. He has very good forward lean and keeps his feet churning like pistons after contact. The former Tide playmaker is dependable as a receiver, with soft hands and the ability to create yards after the catch; in pass protection, he positions himself well but at times needs to sustain blocks longer. He played in a committee role with teammate Josh Jacobs and won’t wow you but projects as a reliable pro running back capable of playing on all three downs.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Rise</strong>
        <p>Harris doesn’t have any major holes in his game, has played against top competition, and will bring toughness and versatility at the next level.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Fall</strong>
        <p>He’s a jack of all trades and master of none.</p>

        <strong>Scouting Report</strong>
        <p>Hill is a twitched-up, physical defensive tackle with an explosive first step (as illustrated by his 35-inch vertical jump) and an aggressive playing style that’s always turned up to 11. He played on the nose and at the three-technique for UCF, where he was frequently the first out of his stance at the snap, firing into the offensive line with power and violence. He plays with heavy hands, has a smooth, easy spin move, and is capable of jumping quickly from gap to gap on stunts. He’ll rush head down and out of control at times, and finds himself on the ground too often. Against the run, he’s adept at shooting gaps to bring ballcarriers down, but can get uprooted against double-teams. He started 26 games in his freshman and sophomore seasons under Scott Frost, but was relegated to rotational duty in 2018 while apparently <a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/ucf-knights/os-sp-ucf-trysten-hill-1231-story.html">clashing with new head coach Josh Heupel in 2018</a>.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Rise</strong>
        <p>Hill is a fantastic gap shooter with an elite first step and an infectiously tenacious demeanor.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Fall</strong>
        <p>He’s reckless as a rusher at times, and will face questions about his maturity and coachability following his junior season.</p>

        <strong>Scouting Report</strong>
        <p>Bunting is extremely physical in coverage, willing to grapple with receivers throughout their route. He’s patient in press and trusts his make-up speed, consistently waiting for the receiver to commit before quickly flipping his hips into trailing position. From there, he brings smothering coverage skills; the former receiver understands route concepts and anticipates when the ball is coming. He had nine interceptions in college and 15 passes defensed. The physical corner isn’t afraid to mix it up against the run.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Rise</strong>
        <p>Bunting combines top-tier athleticism with a cocky demeanor and receiver-like ball skills.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Fall</strong>
        <p>He has a thin, wiry frame, lacks strength, and played at a lower level of competition.</p>

        <strong>Scouting Report</strong>
        <p>Warring is relatively new to football―he played just one season in high school―so he’s still picking up some of the nuances of playing tight end. But the former Aztecs standout boasts a prototypical frame and is a smooth, explosive mover in space who flies off the line of scrimmage as a route runner and blocks with force at the point of attack. In the passing game, he has strong, reliable hands to hold on to passes while taking a hit. Warring is a good in-line blocker in both the run game and pass game, squaring defenders up, latching on, and chopping his feet to sustain his blocks.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Rise</strong>
        <p>Traits, traits, and more traits. Warring has the frame, aggressive demeanor, and athletic talent to develop into a true combo “Y” tight end.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Fall</strong>
        <p>He’s still very raw and played at a lower level of competition at San Diego State. His learning curve in the NFL will be steep.</p>

        <strong>Scouting Report</strong>
        <p>Sternberger is a smooth athlete with a compact, muscled build that allows him to move well over the middle of the field and consistently create explosive plays. He’s a natural catcher who rarely fights the ball, and is quick and powerful after the catch. The Aggie led <a href="http://www.cfbstats.com/2018/leader/national/player/split01/category35/sort02.html">all tight ends in 2018 with 21 receptions of 20-plus yards</a>&nbsp;and paced his team in catches (48), yards (832), yards per catch (17.3), and touchdowns (10). He’s a high-effort blocker on the move and in space, but doesn’t pack much power as a traditional in-line tight end.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Rise</strong>
        <p>Rugged, athletic joker tight end who can line up all over the formation and create big plays up the seam.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Fall</strong>
        <p>Lacks elite explosiveness, and will be a project as a blocker.</p>

        <strong>Scouting Report</strong>
        <p>Hooker has a thick, compact frame and plays with a feisty, physical style. He lined up in multiple roles for Iowa’s defense and excelled when deployed over the slot; in zone looks, he does a good job of cycling his eyes between downfield routes and the quarterback, and when he lines up in man&mdash;especially in the red zone&mdash;he does a great job of crowding and outmuscling slot receivers to disrupt timing and routes. He’s quick to react and come downhill against screens, but can be a bit clunky transitioning to coverage down the seam. Hooker looks much more comfortable back-pedaling in zone looks than running in man. Against the run, he’s a reliable tackler and typically plays with fundamental position and leverage, but will overrun the ballcarrier or get sealed out of a play from time to time. He’s tough to block at the second level, and rag-dolls receivers who test him.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Rise</strong>
        <p>Hooker brings intensity, versatility, and instinctive zone coverage chops to the table.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Fall</strong>
        <p>He’s a down safety only, lacks length, and struggles in man coverage.</p>

        <strong>Scouting Report</strong>
        <p>Crosby has a long, lean frame, springly athleticism, and a motor that runs hot. He knows how to use his length to control blockers and makes it hard for opponents to latch on to him, always slipping, striking, and ripping away from blocks. He has a strong push-pull-rip move and employs hump moves and swim moves effectively. He’s a very good athlete, with speed (4.66-second 40-yard dash), agility (6.89-second 3-cone), and explosiveness (a 36-inch vertical jump). He plays with a tenacious demeanor; is always looking to get hands into passing lanes&mdash;he had three pass knockdowns in 2018; and <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyBKelly/status/1118622039152050177">aggressively punches or rips at the ball</a>&nbsp;when a ballcarrier is within his radius (he’s racked up eight forced fumbles in the past two seasons). Crosby likely needs to add a bit of muscle and weight, but he has the upside and physical talent to be very productive in the NFL. He posted 35.5 tackles for a loss and 18.5 sacks in the past two seasons.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Rise</strong>
        <p>Crosby is long, athletic, versatile, and productive.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Fall</strong>
        <p>He needs to add bulk, and may have a long learning curve to the NFL.</p>

        <strong>Scouting Report</strong>
        <p>Walker has a big, muscular build with a thick lower half and long arms. He’s explosive off the line and has good bend at the top of his rush. He bounds from gap to gap on stunts, showing agility and burst to break through the line. He brings a strong punch and flashes a powerful hump move, though his rush can stall out if his first move doesn’t work. He will come all the way down the line to make a tackle against the run, and is active and physical in pursuit. He has the size to set the edge, but can get washed out of the play at times, so he’ll need to improve his block-shedding techniques at the next level.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Rise</strong>
        <p>Walker has a well-rounded skill set and can add toughness, athleticism, versatility, and upside as a pass rusher to a defensive front.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Fall</strong>
        <p>He lacks prototypical size, and can stand to get stronger against the run.</p>

        <strong>Scouting Report</strong>
        <p>Hardman is a former cornerback who switched to offense as a sophomore and brings dangerous speed and the upside to develop into a more refined all-around receiver with time. Running routes out of the slot, Hardman can use his track speed to win footraces downfield. He tracks the ball well down the sideline and has a powerful lower half to break through tackles. The former Bulldog has soft hands, can adjust to reel in off-target passes, and knows how to use head and shoulder fakes to get open at the top of his stem. He’s small, and struggled at times in contested catch situations. Hardman shows good effort as a blocker to sustain blocks and drive corners out of the play. He is a dynamic punt and kick returner.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Rise</strong>
        <p>Hardman has rare speed and is still just scratching the surface of his potential.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Fall</strong>
        <p>He’s still very raw, lacks size, has a small catch radius, and may be limited as a slot or gadget-type player at the next level.</p>

  Should NFL Teams<br/> Tank for<br/> <b>Tua & <br/>Trevor?</b>

</div>
<div class="content">
<p><strong>The two most pro-ready quarterbacks from college football last season are not in the 2019 NFL draft.</strong></p>
<p>Alabama’s Tua Tagovailoa is the best QB prospect I’ve ever seen. There is never a point during any play when he believes he cannot throw a touchdown&mdash;and over time, I’ve come to learn that with his outrageous arm, rare vision, and excellent mobility, he’s capable of just that. Despite being a risk-taker, he didn’t throw an interception until he already had 26 touchdown passes in the 2018 campaign. And he had the poise to win a national championship as a true freshman. There’s just one problem for NFL teams: He isn’t eligible to join the league until after his junior season, so they’ll have to wait to draft him until 2020 at the earliest.</p>
<p>To some scouts, Clemson’s Trevor Lawrence (who beat Tagovailoa’s Alabama team in January’s national title game) is the best quarterback prospect they’ve ever seen. He has prototypical size, a stronger arm than Tagovailoa, and oh yeah&mdash;the poise to win a national championship as a true freshman. There’s just one problem for NFL teams: He isn’t eligible to join the league until after his junior season, so they’ll have to wait to draft him until 2021 at the earliest.</p>
<p>Quarterbacks are more polished at younger ages than they’ve ever been, and Tagovailoa and Lawrence are the leaders of this trend. They appeared ready for the NFL from the moment they stepped on campus, and as more QBs like them come along, we’ll likely see a wave of pushback against the age restriction that prevents prospects from becoming draft-eligible until they’re three years removed from high school. If both players were eligible now, Tagovailoa and Lawrence would almost certainly be the no. 1 and no. 2 picks in this year’s draft. (Probably Lawrence first, then Tagovailoa.)</p>
<p>Allowing teams to draft freshmen would change the shape of the draft. With less time to evaluate players, there would be even wilder swings and misses than we’re used to. But Lawrence and Tagovailoa would be worth it. That’s great news for fans of teams that were actually good in 2018: The most important tanking opportunities of the decade lie ahead.</p>

        <strong>Scouting Report</strong>
        <p>Hurd is a former five-star running back who started his college career in Tennessee’s backfield before transferring to Baylor and switching to receiver. He’s still new to his new position, but he’s long, athletic, and silky smooth off the line of scrimmage. Lining up primarily in the slot, he drew on a limited route tree but showed the ability to make sharp cuts and gear down quickly to shake defenders. Hurd is dangerous in the open field; he hits the turbo boosters after the catch, and he racked up 48 rush attempts for 209 yards (4.4 YPC) and three touchdowns in 2018, when he showed off plenty of power behind his pads. He had a few drops, but has a wide catch radius and shows courage to reach out for passes over the middle when he knows big hits are coming. Hurd is a work in progress, but has a combination of athleticism and talent that a shrewd offensive coordinator could utilize.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Rise</strong>
        <p>Hurd has untapped potential as an all-around offensive weapon who could be featured in the slot, on the outside, or out of the backfield.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Fall</strong>
        <p>He’s raw, posted a disappointing 4.66-second 40-yard dash at his pro day, and is an older prospect after sitting out a year following his transfer from Tennessee.</p>

        <strong>Scouting Report</strong>
        <p>McLaurin has a slender, wiry frame with lightning-quick feet and top-tier speed. He can get off press coverage and has sure hands to secure slant-route bullets in traffic. He’s scrappy at the catch point, showing the concentration to reel in off-target passes, but isn’t the most physical player, at times getting pushed off his route by bigger, more aggressive corners. McLaurin is always aware of the first-down marker and will dive and spin to pick up the necessary yards. He’s effective on the outside; he tracks the ball well and has very good downfield speed. He’s a high-effort blocker, is a stud special-teams gunner, and was one of the top receiver standouts at the Senior Bowl.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Rise</strong>
        <p>McLaurin combines versatility with top-tier athleticism, and should contribute in Year 1 on special teams.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Fall</strong>
        <p>He never produced big catch or yardage numbers (notching a career-high 705 yards in 2018) and is an older prospect (he’ll be 23 in September); he has very good straight-line speed but isn’t necessarily explosive in the open field.</p>

        <strong>Scouting Report</strong>
        <p>Saunders is a massive defensive tackle with outstanding athleticism. He plays with excellent leverage, power, and quickness, frequently bowling over interior blockers. He was so fleet afoot that he even lined up on the edge at times. He has excellent body control―he can do backflips, for reference―and utilizes a quality club move, swim move, and push-pull move as a pass rusher. Against the run, Saunders easily moves down the line of scrimmage to pursue from the backside or string runs out. He lacks length, can get uprooted against double-teams, and, at times, can struggle to disengage once he’s blocked. He was a Senior Bowl standout but played against a much lower level of competition at Western Illinois.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Rise</strong>
        <p>Saunders has top-tier explosiveness for his size and flashes the playmaking ability to become a gap-shooting tilted nose in a 4-3 front.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Fall</strong>
        <p>He lacks length and may need some time to acclimate to the pro level.</p>

        <strong>Scouting Report</strong>
        <p>Miller is an athletic linebacker with rare length (a massive 82.25-inch wingspan) and the versatility to play all over the front seven. He was primarily an outside linebacker and situational pass rusher for the Tide; as a rusher, he showed good burst to get upfield, and the flexibility to change directions quickly. He’s still developing a repertoire of pass rush moves, but he flashed an effective cross chop and was able to utilize his length with a jolting long-arm stab. Against the run, he sets a strong edge, locks out his arms to keep blocks off his body, and keeps an eye in the backfield to maintain his gap responsibilities.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Rise</strong>
        <p>Miller has the length, bend, and athleticism to be an early-impact player in a number of roles.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Fall</strong>
        <p>He’s an underdeveloped rusher, and he missed time with multiple major injuries in college (including issues with his hamstring, a torn biceps, and a sports hernia).</p>

        <strong>Scouting Report</strong>
        <p>Knox is a premier athlete, but heads into the draft as a traits-based project after catching just 39 passes for 605 yards and no touchdowns in his last two seasons at Ole Miss. He worked as an H-back-style tight end, lining up all over the formation as a blocker or pass catcher. He shoots off the line like a missile, can get up the seam in a hurry, and finished his college career averaging 18.9 yards per catch. Knox has the frame and speed to become a dynamic mismatch creator at the next level, but is raw as a route runner. He’s a very strong run blocker who positions himself well and works his feet through contact, but he can get caught lunging at times.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Rise</strong>
        <p>Knox has rare athleticism and flashes the ability to create mismatches.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Fall</strong>
        <p>He’s raw as a prospect with very little college production.</p>

        <strong>Scouting Report</strong>
        <p>Oliver is a smooth athlete with a massive catch radius and huge hands. The Spartans tight end lined up all over the formation, catching 56 passes for 709 yards and four touchdowns in 2018. He covers a lot of green with long, powerful strides (he ran a 4.63-second 40-yard dash at the combine), wins contested passes, plucks the ball away from his frame, and has excellent body control to contort in the air and position himself to make the catch. He shows plenty of effort in the run game, but lacks the power to control defenders. He projects as a move tight end capable of creating mismatch problems for a defense.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Rise</strong>
        <p>Oliver is a dependable pass-catching mismatch threat who wins at the catch point.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Fall</strong>
        <p>He’s still raw as a route runner and lacks strength as a blocker. He played against a lower level of competition at SJSU.</p>

        <strong>Scouting Report</strong>
        <p>Johnson is a natural playmaker who posted 275 catches for 3,463 yards and 24 touchdowns in his four-year college career. He can run routes on the outside and is comfortable in the slot. He’s effortlessly smooth off the line; snaps off comeback routes with sharp angles back to the quarterback; has dependable hands; and wastes little movement in his transition to running after the catch. Johnson lacks top-end speed (he ran a disappointing 4.6-second 40-yard dash at the combine) but is a good route runner and is elusive after the catch. He’s strong on contested catches, showing the ability to use subtle push-offs to create space at the catch point. He’s an effort blocker who can position himself well to seal away from the play, but lacks play strength in that area.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Rise</strong>
        <p>Johnson has the upside of a quarterback’s best friend thanks to a combination of size, sure hands, and quality route running.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Fall</strong>
        <p>He’s an average athlete who doesn’t have much speed or burst to separate.</p>

        <strong>Scouting Report</strong>
        <p>Sample has a big, rugged frame and smooth, functional athleticism. He isn’t a dynamic route-runner but can threaten the seam and has very good hands, with zero drops in 2018. He’s dominant as a blocker at the point of attack in the run game&mdash;he was <a href="https://www.profootballfocus.com/news/draft-pffs-top-250-big-board-for-the-2019-nfl-draft">PFF’s top-graded run blocker</a>&nbsp;at the position in 2018&mdash;and uses strong hands to grab and drive defenders away from the play or wall them off from the ball. He keeps a balanced, sturdy base to sustain blocks from snap to whistle, and targets in the open field like a heat-seeking missile, finding his man before breaking down and mirroring.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Rise</strong>
        <p>Sample is a three-down tight end with toughness in the trenches and the physical upside to take a big jump as a receiver.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Fall</strong>
        <p>He was never a big part of Washington’s passing game and lacks explosiveness as a receiver.</p>

        <strong>Scouting Report</strong>
        <p>Davis has a squat, powerful frame with massive legs, a rotund midsection, and a wide upper half. He played at right guard his first three seasons at Charlotte before manning the right tackle spot in 2018. Davis has quick feet, good balance, and a strong punch in pass protection. In the run game, he fires out of his stance with a wrecking-ball mentality and is a nasty finisher who plays through the whistle. He can get caught lunging, and while he starts low to the ground like a sumo wrestler in his pre-snap set, he pops upright in pass protection at times and opens himself up to the bull rush.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Rise</strong>
        <p>Davis is a powerful run blocker with the feet to excel in pass protection. He could play in both zone and gap/power schemes.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Fall</strong>
        <p>He lacks ideal length and is likely to be an interior player only at the next level.</p>

        <strong>Scouting Report</strong>
        <p>Ridley has a big, well-proportioned frame with very long arms and huge mitts. His best attribute is his route running; he gets off the line of scrimmage quickly, stresses the cornerback’s cushion, and utilizes sharp cuts to snap routes off and create separation. He’s comfortable working down the sideline and is hard to stop on routes that break back to the quarterback. He’s urgent after the catch, smoothly turning upfield to pick up yards. Ridley is athletically limited and lacked eye-popping production in Georgia’s run-heavy offense, but he did lead the team in catches (43), yards (559), and touchdowns (nine). He projects as a possession receiver at the next level who wins with technique and nuance and not speed or explosiveness.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Rise</strong>
        <p>Ridley’s ability to separate on time underneath could make him an effective possession receiver early in his career.</p>
        <strong>Why He Could Fall</strong>
        <p>He offers a lower ceiling than some of his peers in this class because of his lack of high-end athleticism.</p>

He displayed questionable decision-making, launching throws from off-balance platforms or forcing passes into coverage, and struggled under pressure.<\/p>\n            <strong>Why He Could Rise<\/strong>\n            <p>Jones has the type of moldable traits that NFL teams are looking for; with good size, arm strength, and short and intermediate accuracy, he has the potential to eventually develop into a starter-caliber NFL passer.<\/p>\n            <strong>Why He Could Fall<\/strong>\n            <p>He displays questionable decision-making, throws far too many interceptions, and was very inaccurate on deep passes.<\/p>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"combine-results is-mobile\">\n            <h4 class=\"combine-h4\"><strong>Combine Results<\/strong><\/h4>\n                            <ul class=\"\">\n                                            <li>\n                            <span class=\"label\">Hand size<\/span>\n                            <span class=\"value\">9 3\/4&#039;&#039;<\/span>\n                        <\/li>\n                                            <li>\n                            <span class=\"label\">Arm length<\/span>\n                            <span class=\"value\">32 1\/2&#039;&#039;<\/span>\n                        <\/li>\n                                            <li>\n                            <span class=\"label\">40-yard dash time<\/span>\n                            <span class=\"value\">4.81<\/span>\n                        <\/li>\n                                            <li>\n                            <span class=\"label\">3-cone drill time<\/span>\n                            <span class=\"value\">7<\/span>\n                        <\/li>\n                                            <li>\n                            <span class=\"label\">Short shuttle time<\/span>\n                            <span class=\"value\">4.41<\/span>\n                        <\/li>\n                                    <\/ul>\n            \n        <\/div>\n        <h6 class=\"more-ringer-coverage\">\n        <a href=\"\" class=\"color-theme\">SEE MORE RINGER COVERAGE<\/a>\n    <\/h6>\n    <div class=\"player-social\">\n        <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnfldraft.theringer.com%2Fshare%2Fdanieljones.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"facebook\">Share To Facebook<\/a>\n        <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnfldraft.theringer.com%23danieljones&text=The%20Ringer%E2%80%99s%20All-Encompassing%20Two-Round%20NFL%20Mock%20Draft%20and%20Top-100%20Big%20Board\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"twitter\">Share To Twitter<\/a>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","combine_html":"<h4 class=\"combine-h4\"><strong>Combine Results<\/strong><\/h4>\n    <ul class=\"\">\n                    <li>\n                <span class=\"label\">Hand size<\/span>\n                <span class=\"value\">9 3\/4&#039;&#039;<\/span>\n            <\/li>\n                    <li>\n                <span class=\"label\">Arm length<\/span>\n                <span class=\"value\">32 1\/2&#039;&#039;<\/span>\n            <\/li>\n                    <li>\n                <span class=\"label\">40-yard dash time<\/span>\n                <span class=\"value\">4.81<\/span>\n            <\/li>\n                    <li>\n                <span class=\"label\">3-cone drill time<\/span>\n                <span class=\"value\">7<\/span>\n            <\/li>\n                    <li>\n                <span class=\"label\">Short shuttle time<\/span>\n                <span class=\"value\">4.41<\/span>\n            <\/li>\n            <\/ul>\n","show_updated":false,"share_title":"Where does Daniel Jones land on The Ringer\u2018s 2019 NFL draft board?

He\u2019s tough to block at the second level, and rag-dolls receivers who test him.<\/p>\n            <strong>Why He Could Rise<\/strong>\n            <p>Hooker brings intensity, versatility, and instinctive zone coverage chops to the table.<\/p>\n            <strong>Why He Could Fall<\/strong>\n            <p>He\u2019s a down safety only, lacks length, and struggles in man coverage.<\/p>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"combine-results is-mobile\">\n            <h4 class=\"combine-h4\"><strong>Combine Results<\/strong><\/h4>\n                            <ul class=\"\">\n                                            <li>\n                            <span class=\"label\">Arm length<\/span>\n                            <span class=\"value\">30 1\/8&#039;&#039;<\/span>\n                        <\/li>\n                                            <li>\n                            <span class=\"label\">40-yard dash time<\/span>\n                            <span class=\"value\">4.48<\/span>\n                        <\/li>\n                                            <li>\n                            <span class=\"label\">Short shuttle time<\/span>\n                            <span class=\"value\">4.1<\/span>\n                        <\/li>\n                                            <li>\n                            <span class=\"label\">3-cone drill time<\/span>\n                            <span class=\"value\">6.87<\/span>\n                        <\/li>\n                                            <li>\n                            <span class=\"label\">Vertical jump<\/span>\n                            <span class=\"value\">37&#039;&#039;<\/span>\n                        <\/li>\n                                    <\/ul>\n            \n        <\/div>\n        <h6 class=\"more-ringer-coverage\">\n        <a href=\"\" class=\"color-theme\">SEE MORE RINGER COVERAGE<\/a>\n    <\/h6>\n    <div class=\"player-social\">\n        <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnfldraft.theringer.com%2Fshare%2Famanihooker.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"facebook\">Share To Facebook<\/a>\n        <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnfldraft.theringer.com%23amanihooker&text=The%20Ringer%E2%80%99s%20All-Encompassing%20Two-Round%20NFL%20Mock%20Draft%20and%20Top-100%20Big%20Board\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"twitter\">Share To Twitter<\/a>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","combine_html":"<h4 class=\"combine-h4\"><strong>Combine Results<\/strong><\/h4>\n    <ul class=\"\">\n                    <li>\n                <span class=\"label\">Arm length<\/span>\n                <span class=\"value\">30 1\/8&#039;&#039;<\/span>\n            <\/li>\n                    <li>\n                <span class=\"label\">40-yard dash time<\/span>\n                <span class=\"value\">4.48<\/span>\n            <\/li>\n                    <li>\n                <span class=\"label\">Short shuttle time<\/span>\n                <span class=\"value\">4.1<\/span>\n            <\/li>\n                    <li>\n                <span class=\"label\">3-cone drill time<\/span>\n                <span class=\"value\">6.87<\/span>\n            <\/li>\n                    <li>\n                <span class=\"label\">Vertical jump<\/span>\n                <span class=\"value\">37&#039;&#039;<\/span>\n            <\/li>\n            <\/ul>\n","show_updated":false,"share_title":"Where does Amani Hooker land on The Ringer\u2018s 2019 NFL draft board?

He\u2019s a good athlete with plenty of agility, as illustrated by the elite 1.55 10-yard split he posted in his combine 40-yard dash and his 6.94-second three-cone time.<\/p>\n            <strong>Why He Could Rise<\/strong>\n            <p>Winovich is a disruptive, rugged edge defender with a three-down skill set and a motor that always runs hot.<\/p>\n            <strong>Why He Could Fall<\/strong>\n            <p>He\u2019s aggressive to the point of recklessness, too often playing out over his skis as he shoots forward at the snap; he lacks the prototypical length.<\/p>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"combine-results is-mobile\">\n            <h4 class=\"combine-h4\"><strong>Combine Results<\/strong><\/h4>\n                            <ul class=\"\">\n                                            <li>\n                            <span class=\"label\">Arm length<\/span>\n                            <span class=\"value\">32 3\/4&#039;&#039;<\/span>\n                        <\/li>\n                                            <li>\n                            <span class=\"label\">3-cone drill time<\/span>\n                            <span class=\"value\">6.94<\/span>\n                        <\/li>\n                                            <li>\n                            <span class=\"label\">Short shuttle time<\/span>\n                            <span class=\"value\">4.11<\/span>\n                        <\/li>\n                                            <li>\n                            <span class=\"label\">Broad jump<\/span>\n                            <span class=\"value\">116&#039;&#039;<\/span>\n                        <\/li>\n                                            <li>\n                            <span class=\"label\">Vertical jump<\/span>\n                            <span class=\"value\">30.5&#039;&#039;<\/span>\n                        <\/li>\n                                    <\/ul>\n            \n        <\/div>\n        <h6 class=\"more-ringer-coverage\">\n        <a href=\"\" class=\"color-theme\">SEE MORE RINGER COVERAGE<\/a>\n    <\/h6>\n    <div class=\"player-social\">\n        <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnfldraft.theringer.com%2Fshare%2Fchasewinovich.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"facebook\">Share To Facebook<\/a>\n        <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnfldraft.theringer.com%23chasewinovich&text=The%20Ringer%E2%80%99s%20All-Encompassing%20Two-Round%20NFL%20Mock%20Draft%20and%20Top-100%20Big%20Board\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"twitter\">Share To Twitter<\/a>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","combine_html":"<h4 class=\"combine-h4\"><strong>Combine Results<\/strong><\/h4>\n    <ul class=\"\">\n                    <li>\n                <span class=\"label\">Arm length<\/span>\n                <span class=\"value\">32 3\/4&#039;&#039;<\/span>\n            <\/li>\n                    <li>\n                <span class=\"label\">3-cone drill time<\/span>\n                <span class=\"value\">6.94<\/span>\n            <\/li>\n                    <li>\n                <span class=\"label\">Short shuttle time<\/span>\n                <span class=\"value\">4.11<\/span>\n            <\/li>\n                    <li>\n                <span class=\"label\">Broad jump<\/span>\n                <span class=\"value\">116&#039;&#039;<\/span>\n            <\/li>\n                    <li>\n                <span class=\"label\">Vertical jump<\/span>\n                <span class=\"value\">30.5&#039;&#039;<\/span>\n            <\/li>\n            <\/ul>\n","show_updated":false,"share_title":"Where does Chase Winovich land on The Ringer\u2018s 2019 NFL draft board?

He showed a nose for the ball for the Wolfpack, racking up 104 tackles&mdash;including 10 for a loss&mdash;plus three passes defensed and two forced fumbles in 2018. The former safety understands how routes develop in coverage and showed off excellent effective range and a smooth transition to trailing position to carry running backs or tight ends downfield. When lined up over the slot, he is physical at the line of scrimmage, jamming and rerouting pass catchers. He can slice through the line and finish as a blitzer, and notched 6.0 sacks last season.

He showed a nose for the ball for the Wolfpack, racking up 104 tackles&mdash;including 10 for a loss&mdash;plus three passes defensed and two forced fumbles in 2018. The former safety understands how routes develop in coverage and showed off excellent effective range and a smooth transition to trailing position to carry running backs or tight ends downfield. When lined up over the slot, he is physical at the line of scrimmage, jamming and rerouting pass catchers. He can slice through the line and finish as a blitzer, and notched 6.0 sacks last season. He has very good closing burst and tackle radius and the potential to play inside or outside in both 3-4 and 4-3 schemes. He takes on blocks with a far-too-upright technique, though, leaving him susceptible to getting knocked back or sealed out of the play too easily.

He lined up in multiple roles for Iowa\u2019s defense and excelled when deployed over the slot; in zone looks, he does a good job of cycling his eyes between downfield routes and the quarterback, and when he lines up in man&mdash;especially in the red zone&mdash;he does a great job of crowding and outmuscling slot receivers to disrupt timing and routes. He\u2019s quick to react and come downhill against screens, but can be a bit clunky transitioning to coverage down the seam.

He lined up in multiple roles for Iowa\u2019s defense and excelled when deployed over the slot; in zone looks, he does a good job of cycling his eyes between downfield routes and the quarterback, and when he lines up in man&mdash;especially in the red zone&mdash;he does a great job of crowding and outmuscling slot receivers to disrupt timing and routes. He\u2019s quick to react and come downhill against screens, but can be a bit clunky transitioning to coverage down the seam. Hooker looks much more comfortable back-pedaling in zone looks than running in man. Against the run, he\u2019s a reliable tackler and typically plays with fundamental position and leverage, but will overrun the ballcarrier or get sealed out of a play from time to time.

He is a three-year starter who learned under former Eli and Peyton Manning tutor David Cutcliffe at Duke, and playing in an RPO-heavy offense, he displayed the ability to go through reads and throw with accuracy at the short and intermediate levels. Jones is very athletic, capable of running away from defenders if he finds some daylight, and rushed for 17 touchdowns in his college career.

He has the athleticism to carry running backs out of the backfield.<\/p>\n            <strong>Why He Could Rise<\/strong>\n            <p>Cashman has outstanding sideline-to-sideline speed and is an extremely reliable tackler.<\/p>\n            <strong>Why He Could Fall<\/strong>\n            <p>He\u2019s slightly undersized and may be limited to playing on the weak side in the NFL.<\/p>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"combine-results is-mobile\">\n            <h4 class=\"combine-h4\"><strong>Combine Results<\/strong><\/h4>\n                            <ul class=\"\">\n                                            <li>\n                            <span class=\"label\">40-yard dash time<\/span>\n                            <span class=\"value\">4.5<\/span>\n                        <\/li>\n                                            <li>\n                            <span class=\"label\">Short shuttle time<\/span>\n                            <span class=\"value\">4.12<\/span>\n                        <\/li>\n                                            <li>\n                            <span class=\"label\">3-cone drill time<\/span>\n                            <span class=\"value\">6.95<\/span>\n                        <\/li>\n                                            <li>\n                            <span class=\"label\">Broad jump<\/span>\n                            <span class=\"value\">124&#039;&#039;<\/span>\n                        <\/li>\n                                            <li>\n                            <span class=\"label\">Vertical jump<\/span>\n                            <span class=\"value\">37.5&#039;&#039;<\/span>\n                        <\/li>\n                                    <\/ul>\n            \n        <\/div>\n        <h6 class=\"more-ringer-coverage\">\n        <a href=\"\" class=\"color-theme\">SEE MORE RINGER COVERAGE<\/a>\n    <\/h6>\n    <div class=\"player-social\">\n        <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnfldraft.theringer.com%2Fshare%2Fblakecashman.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"facebook\">Share To Facebook<\/a>\n        <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnfldraft.theringer.com%23blakecashman&text=The%20Ringer%E2%80%99s%20All-Encompassing%20Two-Round%20NFL%20Mock%20Draft%20and%20Top-100%20Big%20Board\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"twitter\">Share To Twitter<\/a>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","combine_html":"<h4 class=\"combine-h4\"><strong>Combine Results<\/strong><\/h4>\n    <ul class=\"\">\n                    <li>\n                <span class=\"label\">40-yard dash time<\/span>\n                <span class=\"value\">4.5<\/span>\n            <\/li>\n                    <li>\n                <span class=\"label\">Short shuttle time<\/span>\n                <span class=\"value\">4.12<\/span>\n            <\/li>\n                    <li>\n                <span class=\"label\">3-cone drill time<\/span>\n                <span class=\"value\">6.95<\/span>\n            <\/li>\n                    <li>\n                <span class=\"label\">Broad jump<\/span>\n                <span class=\"value\">124&#039;&#039;<\/span>\n            <\/li>\n                    <li>\n                <span class=\"label\">Vertical jump<\/span>\n                <span class=\"value\">37.5&#039;&#039;<\/span>\n            <\/li>\n            <\/ul>\n","show_updated":false,"share_title":"Where does Blake Cashman land on The Ringer\u2018s 2019 NFL draft board?

He showed a nose for the ball for the Wolfpack, racking up 104 tackles&mdash;including 10 for a loss&mdash;plus three passes defensed and two forced fumbles in 2018. The former safety understands how routes develop in coverage and showed off excellent effective range and a smooth transition to trailing position to carry running backs or tight ends downfield. When lined up over the slot, he is physical at the line of scrimmage, jamming and rerouting pass catchers. He can slice through the line and finish as a blitzer, and notched 6.0 sacks last season.

He showed a nose for the ball for the Wolfpack, racking up 104 tackles&mdash;including 10 for a loss&mdash;plus three passes defensed and two forced fumbles in 2018. The former safety understands how routes develop in coverage and showed off excellent effective range and a smooth transition to trailing position to carry running backs or tight ends downfield. When lined up over the slot, he is physical at the line of scrimmage, jamming and rerouting pass catchers. He can slice through the line and finish as a blitzer, and notched 6.0 sacks last season. He has very good closing burst and tackle radius and the potential to play inside or outside in both 3-4 and 4-3 schemes. He takes on blocks with a far-too-upright technique, though, leaving him susceptible to getting knocked back or sealed out of the play too easily.

He\u2019s a very good athlete, with speed (4.66-second 40-yard dash), agility (6.89-second 3-cone), and explosiveness (a 36-inch vertical jump).

He\u2019s still new to his new position, but he\u2019s long, athletic, and silky smooth off the line of scrimmage. Lining up primarily in the slot, he drew on a limited route tree but showed the ability to make sharp cuts and gear down quickly to shake defenders.

That\u2019s good news, considering the team doesn\u2019t have a pick until the third round of this year\u2019s draft. Only two of the Bears\u2019 22 starters left in free agency, and the team has already filled both those spots with free agent deals for Buster Skrine and Ha Ha Clinton-Dix. The latter\u2019s contract is only for one year, so general manager Ryan Pace could look to add some depth at the position later in the draft. The same goes for edge rusher, where the Bears lost backup outside linebacker Aaron Lynch in free agency. At this point, that\u2019s just nitpicking, though. Chicago\u2019s defense remains loaded.<br><\/p>\n<p>There aren\u2019t many needs on the other side of the ball, either.

Even as more and more teams start diving into the free agent pool, Cincinnati continues to act like that pool is shark infested. The front office has long prioritized retaining its own players, and this year was no exception. Before free agency began, you could\u2019ve easily argued that the Bengals would be candidates to upgrade from right tackle Bobby Hart, linebacker Preston Brown, and cornerback Darqueze Dennard, who were&nbsp;all free agents. Instead, the Bengals re-signed all three! Considering Hart was one of the worst pass-blocking tackles in the NFL last year, handing him a three-year deal was truly shocking (even if most of his guaranteed money came in the form of a roster bonus this season). He isn\u2019t the long-term answer at the position, and the Bengals should be looking for one. Cincinnati could also use an upgrade at right guard, and left guard Clint Boling is going into the final year of his contract this season. This team\u2019s continuing offensive line issues are devastating, considering the draft capital the front office has invested along that front in recent years. The Bengals traded back nine spots in the first round last season (from no. 12 to no. 21) in order to get left tackle Cordy Glenn from Buffalo. Not long after, they spent a first-round pick on Ohio State center Billy Price. That came three years after Cincinnati used first- <i>and <\/i>second-round picks on tackles that didn\u2019t work out.

Payton clearly thinks that the Saints could use a middle-of-the-field threat for Drew Brees, but it's possible that recently signed tight end Jared Cook can fill that role.<\/p>","category":"teams","order":"22","completed":"1","updated":"2019-04-01T22:41:19-0700","production_status":"1","staging_status":"1","deleted":"0"},"22":{"id":"2","type":"ringernfl2018","title":"New York Giants","title_font_size":"","image":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/nfldraft-theringer-com-cms\/legacy\/media\/386px-New_York_Giants_logo.svg.png","picks":{"0":{"number":"6","how":"<p>New York's own first-round pick<\/p>","form":{},"count":1},"1":{"number":"17","how":"<p>From Cleveland in 2019 trade that sent Odell Beckham Jr. to the Browns for&nbsp;Jabrill Peppers and a 2019 third-round pick<\/p>","form":{},"count":2},"2":{"number":"37","how":"<p>New York's own second-round pick<\/p>","form":{},"count":3},"3":{"number":"95","how":"<p>From trade mentioned above<\/p>","form":{},"count":4}},"needs":{"0":{"need":"Quarterback","form":{},"count":1},"1":{"need":"Wide receiver","form":{},"count":2},"2":{"need":"Offensive tackle","form":{},"count":3},"3":{"need":"Cornerback","form":{},"count":4},"4":{"need":"Edge rusher","form":{},"count":5},"5":{"need":"Linebacker","form":{},"count":6}},"players_headline":"<span>Friendly<\/span><br\/><span>Suggestions<\/span>","players":{"0":{"title":"Dwayne Haskins","title_size":"","player_image":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/nfldraft-theringer-com-cms\/legacy\/media\/Dwayne-Haskins_Getty.png","image_offset_top":"","image_offset_left":"","opinion":"Friendly Suggestion","position":"Quarterback","school":"Ohio State","scouting_link":"https:\/\/nfldraft.theringer.com#dwaynehaskins","blurb":"","form":{},"count":1,"uploading":false},"1":{"title":"Jonah Williams","title_size":"","player_image":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/nfldraft-theringer-com-cms\/legacy\/media\/Jonah-Williams_Getty.png","image_offset_top":"","image_offset_left":"","opinion":"Friendly Suggestion","position":"Offensive tackle","school":"Alabama","scouting_link":"http:\/\/nfldraft.theringer.com\/#JonahWilliamshttps:\/\/nfldraft.theringer.com#jonahwilliams","blurb":"","form":{},"count":2,"uploading":false},"2":{"title":"Brian Burns","title_size":"","player_image":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/nfldraft-theringer-com-cms\/legacy\/media\/Brian-Burns_APImages.png","image_offset_top":"","image_offset_left":"","opinion":"Friendly Suggestion","position":"Edge rusher","school":"Florida State","scouting_link":"https:\/\/nfldraft.theringer.com#brianburns","blurb":"","form":{},"count":3,"uploading":false}},"history":"<p>General manager Dave Gettleman\u2019s decision to deal his best player for a couple picks and an average safety is even more depressing for Giants fans when you consider just how little talent is left on this roster.

The interior of the defensive line could also use an upgrade in talent next to Gerald McCoy&mdash;and also a plan for when the 31-year-old defensive tackle eventually moves on.<\/p>","category":"teams","order":"30","completed":"1","updated":"2019-04-01T22:45:08-0700","production_status":"1","staging_status":"1","deleted":"0"},"30":{"id":"32","type":"ringernfl2018","title":"Tennessee Titans","title_font_size":"","image":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/nfldraft-theringer-com-cms\/legacy\/media\/750px-Tennessee_Titans_logo.svg.png","picks":{"0":{"number":"19","how":"<p>Tennessee's own first-round pick<\/p>","count":1},"1":{"number":"51","how":"<p>Tennessee's own second-round pick<\/p>","count":2},"2":{"number":"82","how":"<p>Tennessee's own third-round pick<\/p>","count":3}},"needs":{"0":{"need":"Guard","count":1},"1":{"need":"Defensive tackle","count":2},"2":{"need":"Edge rusher","count":3},"3":{"need":"Quarterback (?)","count":4}},"players_headline":"<span>Friendly<\/span><br\/><span>Suggestions<\/span>","players":{"0":{"title":"Dalton Risner","title_size":"","player_image":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/nfldraft-theringer-com-cms\/legacy\/media\/Dalton-Risner.png","image_offset_top":"","image_offset_left":"","opinion":"Friendly Suggestion","position":"Offensive lineman","school":"Kansas State","scouting_link":"https:\/\/nfldraft.theringer.com#daltonrisner","blurb":"","form":{},"count":1,"uploading":false},"1":{"title":"Christian Wilkins","title_size":"","player_image":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/nfldraft-theringer-com-cms\/legacy\/media\/Christian-Wilkins_Getty.png","image_offset_top":"","image_offset_left":"","opinion":"Friendly Suggestion","position":"Interior defensive lineman","school":"Clemson","scouting_link":"https:\/\/nfldraft.theringer.com#christianwilkins","blurb":"","form":{},"count":2,"uploading":false},"2":{"title":"Brian Burns","title_size":"","player_image":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/nfldraft-theringer-com-cms\/legacy\/media\/Brian-Burns_APImages.png","image_offset_top":"","image_offset_left":"","opinion":"Friendly Suggestion","position":"Edge rusher","school":"Florida State","scouting_link":"https:\/\/nfldraft.theringer.com#brianburns","blurb":"","form":{},"count":3,"uploading":false}},"history":"<p>The Titans filled one guard spot by signing former Rams lineman Rodger Saffold to a sizable deal (four years, $44 million with $22.5 million guaranteed) this spring, but with Quenton Spain hitting free agency, Tennessee still has a hole on the other side of the line. Elsewhere on the offense, the team signed slot man Adam Humphries to a deal in free agency. General manager Jon Robinson could still look for another outside receiver to pair with 2017 first-round pick Corey Davis. But with Davis, Humphries, Taywan Taylor, and the tight end pair of Jonnu Smith and Delanie Walker, he may not see pass catchers as a priority.<\/p>\n<p>Tennessee\u2019s needs on defense are a little easier to identify. The Titans could use another interior presence next to star tackle Jurrell Casey, and even after signing 37-year-old Cam Wake to a three-year deal, the defense could benefit from some more edge-rushing depth. All in all, though, Robinson has built a strong roster without many glaring deficiencies.

Case Keenum is a short-term stopgap at quarterback that covers Washington while Alex Smith recovers from a badly broken leg, but the team is still expected to take a QB early in the draft. Washington signed Landon Collins to a massive six-year, $84 million contract with nearly $45 million in guarantees, and it still could use another safety. Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie\u2019s return from a short retirement solves one cornerback problem, but Washington still needs another. And upgrades at linebacker aren\u2019t out of the question, either, which is why the Redskins were reportedly interested in clearing cap space for C.J. Mosley earlier this month. The former Ravens linebacker landed on the Jets with fellow free agent and former Redskins receiver Jamison Crowder. With Crowder gone, Washington is relying on Paul Richardson, disappointing Josh Doctson, and not much else at wide receiver. Outside of a few spots along the offensive and defensive line, pretty much any position will be in play for Washington in the draft.<\/p>","category":"teams","order":"32","completed":"1","updated":"2019-04-01T22:46:05-0700","production_status":"1","staging_status":"1","deleted":"0"}};

Former Eagles linebacker Jordan Hicks instantly upgrades Arizona&rsquo;s corps, and both Darius Philon and Terrell Suggs should provide useful defensive line depth. The 36-year-old Suggs came to his home state on a one-year deal worth $7 million, so the Cardinals could still try to find some young pass-rush help in this year&rsquo;s draft. But for the most part, Arizona has found temporary solutions for its defensive issues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same can&rsquo;t be said for the offense. Even after trading for Steelers right tackle Marcus Gilbert, Arizona could still look for a tackle in this year&rsquo;s draft to eventually replace D.J. Humphries (who&rsquo;s in the final year of his rookie deal). A succession plan is also necessary for Larry Fitzgerald. The future Hall of Famer will be on the roster this season, but even with him and second-year wideout Christian Kirk, Josh Rosen (or whoever Arizona ends up starting under center) will still need more help at receiver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-card&quot;

The Falcons lost Tevin Coleman, so they could use some running back depth behind Devonta Freeman, and they might want to upgrade from Ty Sambrailo at right tackle, but most of their needs are on defense. Even if Atlanta can find a way to keep Grady Jarrett on a long-term deal (he&rsquo;s playing this season on the franchise tag), it&rsquo;ll need more talent on the interior of the defensive line. The same goes for edge rusher, where Vic Beasley&rsquo;s struggles and Takk McKinley&rsquo;s slow development have seriously hurt the Falcons pass rush. Former second-round pick Isaiah Oliver and Desmond Trufant will hold down two cornerback spots, but Dan Quinn&rsquo;s defense is worryingly thin at the position after losing nickel corner Brian Poole in free agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-card&quot;

Deals for Cole Beasley and John Brown shouldn&rsquo;t prevent Buffalo from considering a true no. 1 outside receiver early, and contracts for center Mitch Morse and swing tackle Ty Nsekhe shouldn&rsquo;t discourage GM Brandon Beane from using high picks on the offensive line. The Bills &lt;i&gt;seem &lt;/i&gt;to be the most set on the defensive line and in the secondary, but defensive end Jerry Hughes will be a free agent after this season, counterpart Trent Murphy has just $1.8 million in dead money left on his contract after 2019, and the team&rsquo;s only multiyear commitment at cornerback is to 2017 first-round pick Tre&rsquo;Davious White. Buffalo certainly needs more help on offense than defense, but Beane should pounce if the right defensive player is available in the first couple of rounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-card&quot;

offensive line situation is considerably better than it could have been heading into the draft. But that area still needs work. Carolina will look to upgrade at left guard, and Williams is only a temporary solution at tackle. The best option may be drafting a left tackle of the future, which would allow Taylor Moton to move to the right side. Free agency also provided some immediate pass rush relief in the form of Bruce Irvin, but the Panthers still aren&rsquo;t nearly good enough up front. Mario Addison&rsquo;s contract hasn&rsquo;t paid off like the franchise would&rsquo;ve hoped, and Julius Peppers&rsquo;s retirement left a big hole on the defensive line. The Panthers are also quite thin at cornerback, and it might be time to find some reinforcements there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-card&quot; data-id=26&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-top-section&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;top-title&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;logo-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=&quot;

That&rsquo;s good news, considering the team doesn&rsquo;t have a pick until the third round of this year&rsquo;s draft. Only two of the Bears&rsquo; 22 starters left in free agency, and the team has already filled both those spots with free agent deals for Buster Skrine and Ha Ha Clinton-Dix. The latter&rsquo;s contract is only for one year, so general manager Ryan Pace could look to add some depth at the position later in the draft. The same goes for edge rusher, where the Bears lost backup outside linebacker Aaron Lynch in free agency. At this point, that&rsquo;s just nitpicking, though. Chicago&rsquo;s defense remains loaded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There aren&rsquo;t many needs on the other side of the ball, either. Pace signed right tackle Bobby Massie to an extension earlier this year to keep him from hitting free agency, and guard Kyle Long recently restructured his deal to stay with the team. The Bears just traded running back Jordan Howard to the Eagles for a conditional 2020 draft pick, so while the starting job now belongs to free-agent acquisition Mike Davis, Pace may look to bolster the position late in the draft. &amp;nbsp;They could also look to add some more depth on the interior of the offensive line, as center Cody Whitehair is set to become a free agent next spring, and the Bears don&rsquo;t have a ready-made replacement on the roster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-card&quot;

Even as more and more teams start diving into the free agent pool, Cincinnati continues to act like that pool is shark infested. The front office has long prioritized retaining its own players, and this year was no exception. Before free agency began, you could&rsquo;ve easily argued that the Bengals would be candidates to upgrade from right tackle Bobby Hart, linebacker Preston Brown, and cornerback Darqueze Dennard, who were&amp;nbsp;all free agents. Instead, the Bengals re-signed all three! Considering Hart was one of the worst pass-blocking tackles in the NFL last year, handing him a three-year deal was truly shocking (even if most of his guaranteed money came in the form of a roster bonus this season). He isn&rsquo;t the long-term answer at the position, and the Bengals should be looking for one. Cincinnati could also use an upgrade at right guard, and left guard Clint Boling is going into the final year of his contract this season. This team&rsquo;s continuing offensive line issues are devastating, considering the draft capital the front office has invested along that front in recent years. The Bengals traded back nine spots in the first round last season (from no. 12 to no. 21) in order to get left tackle Cordy Glenn from Buffalo. Not long after, they spent a first-round pick on Ohio State center Billy Price. That came three years after Cincinnati used first- &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;second-round picks on tackles that didn&rsquo;t work out. It&rsquo;s brutal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of failed first-round picks, the Bengals &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001018968/article/bengals-shopping-wr-john-ross-after-two-seasons&quot;&gt;were reported&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to be actively shopping 2017 first-rounder John Ross at the start of the offseason, and they could use another outside receiving option alongside A.J. Green and slot receiver Tyler Boyd.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-card&quot; data-id=14&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-top-section&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;top-title&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;logo-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=&quot;

roster to land Odell Beckham Jr. and Olivier Vernon, which took care of the Browns&rsquo; needs at wide receiver and edge rusher. But Dorsey sent starting safety Jabrill Peppers to New York as part of the Beckham deal, and that opened up a new hole opposite Damarious Randall. Cleveland could also use some help at linebacker (starter Christian Kirksey signed a big-money contract in 2017, but that deal was orchestrated by the previous regime and only has $2.5 million in dead money remaining after this season). On offense, left tackle Greg Robinson signed a one-year deal this offseason to remain with the team, but that shouldn&rsquo;t be a deterrent should Dorsey see a worthwhile tackle in this draft class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-card&quot;

Yet even with Covington in the fold, Dallas could stand to add quality interior defensive linemen. With Randy Gregory now suspended indefinitely for violating the league&rsquo;s substance abuse policy, the team also had a huge hole opposite Demarcus Lawrence at defensive end. It addressed that in part by trading with the Dolphins to acquire pass rusher Robert Quinn. &amp;nbsp;Safety is another spot on the defense that could use some work. It wouldn&rsquo;t be surprising to see Iloka win the starting job next to incumbent free safety Xavier Woods, but a true blue-chip talent would go a long way in helping the Dallas defense become one of the league&rsquo;s best. The offense is pretty much set, outside of the pass catchers. Trading for Amari Cooper filled one of the outside receiver spots, but after losing Cole Beasley in free agency, the Cowboys could stand to add a receiver or two. The same goes for tight end, where the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2019/2/28/18245184/jason-witten-unretire-dallas-cowboys-monday-night-football&quot;&gt;return of 36-year-old Jason Witten&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a temporary solution at best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-card&quot; data-id=7&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-top-section&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;top-title&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;logo-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=&quot; data-src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/nfldraft-theringer-com-cms/legacy/media/Denver_Broncos_logo.svg.png&quot; class=&quot;team-logo&quot; alt=&quot;Denver Broncos Logo&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-name&quot; style=&quot;font-size:&quot;&gt;Denver Broncos&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-picks-needs-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-picks&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;team-picks-header&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;team-pick-number&quot;&gt;Top Picks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;team-pick-text&quot;&gt;How They Acquired It&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;team-picks-header&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;team-pick-number&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;team-pick-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Denver&rsquo;s own first-round pick&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;team-picks-header&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;team-pick-number&quot;&gt;41&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;team-pick-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Denver&rsquo;s own second-round pick&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;team-picks-header&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;team-pick-number&quot;&gt;71&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;team-pick-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Denver&rsquo;s own third-round pick&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-needs&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-needs-header&quot;&gt;Team Needs&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;team-need&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tight end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;team-need&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Offensive lineman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;team-need&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Quarterback (?)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;team-need&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Safety&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-section player-count-&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-players-headline&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Friendly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Suggestions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nfldraft.theringer.com#tjhockenson&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;team-player no-silo&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-image-column&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=&quot; data-src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/nfldraft-theringer-com-cms/legacy/media/T.J.-Hockenson.png&quot; alt=&quot;T.J.

The Broncos traded for Flacco earlier this month, but the 34-year-old has no dead money remaining on his deal; the succession plan for Denver could take shape quickly. While the team needs a better long-term plan at QB, the tight end position may be the most pressing concern in the short term. Jeff Heuerman finished with just 31 receptions last year, and the Broncos should look to take advantage of a loaded tight end class. John Elway would also be well served to consider drafting some reinforcements on the offensive line. Denver gave right tackle Ja&rsquo;Wuan James a market-setting four-year, $51 million deal, but it could still look to add a center to replace Matt Paradis or try to upgrade at guard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-card&quot;

By adding Preston Smith and Za&rsquo;Darius Smith on the edge and Adrian Amos at safety, the Packers defense has fewer deficiencies than at any point in recent years. Linebacker Blake Martinez is entering the final year of his rookie contract, and Green Bay could look for his replacement in the draft. The same goes for oft-injured right tackle Bryan Bulaga, who recently turned 30 and is entering the final year of his current deal. The Packers&rsquo; only notable loss in free agency was wide receiver Randall Cobb. Green Bay used two picks last season on receivers (Marquez Valdes-Scantling and Equanimeous St. Brown), but neither of them profile as a middle-of-the-field option. Considering Jimmy Graham&rsquo;s forgettable first season with the team, the Packers could look to add that between-the-numbers pass catcher at receiver or tight end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;list_inter&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;div class=&quot;inter-subtitle&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inter-title&quot;&gt; How Did We Get &lt;br/&gt;Here with &lt;b&gt;Kyler &lt;br/&gt;Murray?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inter-byline&quot;&gt; BY Rodger Sherman &lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/nfldraft-theringer-com-cms/legacy/media/kyler-murray-interstitial-x-small.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/nfldraft-theringer-com-cms/legacy/media/kyler-murray-interstitial-x-small.png&quot; alt=&quot;How Did We Get Here With Kyler Murray?&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I cannot believe that we&rsquo;ve gotten to this point with Kyler Murray.&lt;/strong&gt; I&rsquo;d already given up on the idea of ever seeing him play football again. His lone season as Oklahoma&rsquo;s starting quarterback was one of the greatest introductions to the sport that a player has ever made, and it also felt like one of the great farewell tours. It&rsquo;s rare and beautiful for a first-year starter to win the Heisman Trophy; it&rsquo;s rarer and more poignant for that guy to be someone who has already committed to a career in another sport. The Oakland A&rsquo;s nabbed Murray ninth overall in the 2018 MLB draft, guaranteeing him millions of dollars to give up life as an undersized QB to become one of the centerpieces of the franchise&rsquo;s outfield plan. Murray&rsquo;s future was set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until he made clear that he is better at playing quarterback than he ever will be at anything else, that is. Murray just put together the second-most efficient passing season in college football history, and was even more impressive as a runner. I&rsquo;ve never seen anybody else change directions at high speeds the way he does. I cannot stress this enough: In baseball, players almost never change directions. They are required, by rule, to run counterclockwise around a diamond. Football is the sport for Kyler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the life of me, I&rsquo;ll never understand why the A&rsquo;s drafted Murray and then let him play football for the Sooners. They ran the risk of injury, for one, and also the risk of this&amp;mdash;Murray emerging as a superstar in the other sport and never coming back to baseball.

most pressing positional need. Deshaun Watson was pressured on a league-leading 44.7 percent of his dropbacks last season, and while his tendency to hold on to the ball contributed to that, Houston&rsquo;s tackles consistently faltered in pass protection. The Texans didn&rsquo;t address the issue in free agency, a decision that was likely financially motivated: Capable tackles are some of the most overpaid players on the open market each year. Rather than bid for the right to pay Ja&rsquo;Wuan James $32 million guaranteed like the Broncos did, Houston seems content to find a new tackle (or two) via the draft.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Texans could also use some reinforcements on the interior of their defensive front, after losing Christian Covington in free agency, and at cornerback. The recently signed Bradley Roby is playing on a one-year deal, and 2019 is the final season of 34-year-old Johnathan Joseph&rsquo;s contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-card&quot;

The only spot in the offense that could seriously use an influx of talent is wide receiver. The Colts signed former Panthers wideout Devin Funchess to a one-year deal this spring, but given that Dontrelle Inman was used as Indy&rsquo;s no. 2 option last season, Luck could still use more pass-catching options. It&rsquo;s possible that the addition of Funchess and the return of 2018 sixth-round pick Deon Cain (who looked promising in training camp last season before tearing his ACL) will be enough of an upgrade for general manager Chris Ballard, but I doubt it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Colts took care of one starting edge rusher spot last week by signing former Chiefs star Justin Houston to a two-year deal, but they could still use more help up front. Defensive tackles Denico Autry and Margus Hunt had career years in 2018, but a dynamic interior presence could take the Colts defensive line to another level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-card&quot;

But the front office had to ransack a previously stocked roster to get the financial wiggle room to make that signing possible. The Jags released both of their starting safeties over the past year and didn&rsquo;t address that hole early in free agency. The team also released starting right tackle Jermey Parnell earlier this month without a proven replacement on the roster. Improving the offensive line should be Jacksonville&rsquo;s top priority on offense now that the team has found its quarterback, but Foles would also benefit from a pass-catching tight end. The QB was at his best when working with Zach Ertz in Philadelphia, and the Jags could look for a similar option in a draft that&rsquo;s loaded with that type of tight end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-card&quot;

pass defense last season knows this team could use all the help it can find on the back end. Even after signing Tyrann Mathieu to a three-year, $42 million deal in free agency, Kansas City should look to add another safety. The same is true at cornerback, where the Chiefs lost out on signing Ronald Darby (he landed a one-year, $8.5 million deal from the Eagles) before eventually landing Bashaud Breeland on a one-year, up to $5 million deal. Unfortunately, the secondary isn&rsquo;t the only place where the Chiefs defense is thin. After deciding to release Justin Houston and sending franchise-tagged pass rusher Dee Ford to San Francisco in a trade, the Chiefs need reinforcements on the edge. Signing Alex Okafor to a three-year, $17.9 million deal is a good start, but even with Okafor and 2018 second-round pick Breeland Speaks&amp;mdash;who&rsquo;s struggled to have much of an impact as a pass rusher&amp;mdash;Kansas City should look to add even more talent at those spots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-card&quot;

Starting safety Jahleel Addae and starting defensive tackle Corey Liuget were both let go, and wide receiver Tyrell Williams signed a monster contract with the Raiders in free agency. After re-signing free safety Adrian Phillips, the Chargers may feel set at safety even without Addae, but last season, coordinator Gus Bradley&rsquo;s defensive-back-heavy approach necessitated plenty of depth on the back end.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team&rsquo;s more pressing issues come along the offensive and defensive lines. The Chargers re-signed nose tackle Brandon Mebane to a two-year $10.6 million deal but let Liuget and reserve defensive tackle Damion Square walk in free agency. With Joey Bosa and Melvin Ingram on the outside, the Chargers have one of the top pass-rushing duos in the NFL, but they&rsquo;re extremely thin on the inside. The same is true at right tackle, where the Chargers had to rely heavily on 2017 sixth-round pick Sam Tevi last season. If 2017 second-rounder Forrest Lamp is healthy enough to start this year and incumbent right guard Michael Schofield can bump to tackle (where he has starting experience), the Chargers may feel like they have enough of an answer, but they should probably add a tackle in the draft regardless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-card&quot;

Edge rusher was a priority coming into the offseason, but since the team has retained Dante Fowler Jr. on a one-year deal and brought in Clay Matthews, that&rsquo;s no longer an immediate concern. The same goes for safety, where the Rams landed Eric Weddle on a two-year, $10.5 million deal that looks like one of the best bargains in free agency this year. Ndamukong Suh left in free agency, so the Rams could use another defensive tackle to play next to Aaron Donald. It also wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to seek out some help at inside linebacker or find a third safety to use in a big nickel package. But for the most part, the Rams aren&rsquo;t lacking for defensive talent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The area on the roster that probably needs the most attention is the offensive line. Starting guard Rodger Saffold was handed a big deal by the Titans in free agency, and the Rams declined center John Sullivan&rsquo;s 2019 option. Sean McVay could decide to replace those players with in-house second-year options Brian Allen and Joseph Noteboom for this season. But if the Rams&rsquo; plan is for Noteboom to eventually take over for Whitworth at left tackle, they should probably start building a bit more depth on the interior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-card&quot;

Minnesota was perilously thin on the interior of the offensive line, and even after signing Kline they still need to add another body at the position. Retaining defensive tackle Shamar Stephen helps ease the pain of losing Sheldon Richardson in free agency, but Minnesota could use more depth on the interior of the defensive line. It&rsquo;s strange to think, considering they might have the best receiver tandem in the NFL with Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs, but the Vikings could also use a third complementary pass-catching option.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because this is the Vikings, an early-round cornerback selection is always on the table&amp;mdash;but this season, it may be warranted. Minnesota was actively shopping Trae Waynes earlier in the offseason, and he&rsquo;s entering the final year of his deal. Slot cornerback Mackensie Alexander is also entering the last year of his rookie contract, so even with 2018 first-round pick Mike Hughes taking over one starting spot, the team may have another opening soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-card&quot;

creative approach to team building rarely leaves them with many obvious needs. Need a new pass rusher after losing Trey Flowers in free agency? Poof, there&rsquo;s Michael Bennett via trade. Looking for a replacement left tackle after the Raiders gave Trent Brown the largest-ever contract for an offensive lineman? Enter 2018 first-round pick Isaiah Wynn. New England needs to add a tight end after Rob Gronkowski&rsquo;s retirement, and it could use help at receiver after missing on Adam Humphries and Golden Tate in free agency. But for the most part Bill Belichick can use his stockpile of early-round picks (five in the first three rounds) to reload his roster however he sees fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-card&quot; data-id=29&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-top-section&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;top-title&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;logo-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=&quot; data-src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/nfldraft-theringer-com-cms/legacy/media/384px-New_Orleans_Saints_logo.svg.png&quot; class=&quot;team-logo&quot; alt=&quot;New Orleans Saints Logo&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-name&quot; style=&quot;font-size:&quot;&gt;New Orleans Saints&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-picks-needs-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-picks&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;team-picks-header&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;team-pick-number&quot;&gt;Top Picks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;team-pick-text&quot;&gt;How They Acquired It&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;team-picks-header&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;team-pick-number&quot;&gt;62&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;team-pick-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Orleans&rsquo;s own second-round pick&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-needs&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-needs-header&quot;&gt;Team Needs&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;team-need&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Safety&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;team-need&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Linebacker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;team-need&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Edge rusher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-section player-count-&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-players-headline&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Friendly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Suggestions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nfldraft.theringer.com#chaunceygardnerjohnson&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;team-player s no-silo&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-image-column&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=&quot; data-src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/nfldraft-theringer-com-cms/legacy/media/Chauncey-Gardner-Johnson.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chauncey Gardner-Johnson&quot; class=&quot;team-player-image&quot; style=&quot;transform: translate(, )&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-info-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-name&quot; style=&quot;font-size:&quot;&gt;Chauncey Gardner-Johnson&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-position&quot;&gt;Safety&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-school&quot;&gt;Florida&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nfldraft.theringer.com#ljcollier&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;team-player de no-silo&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-image-column&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=&quot; data-src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/nfldraft-theringer-com-cms/legacy/media/L.J.-Collier_Getty.png&quot; alt=&quot;L.J.

Their most pressing needs coming into this offseason were a replacement running back for Mark Ingram, a center to step in for the retired Max Unger, and help on the interior of the defensive line. They&rsquo;ve already addressed all three (with Latavius Murray, Nick Easton, and Malcom Brown, respectively). New Orleans could probably use some depth at linebacker, edge rusher, and safety, but this team isn&rsquo;t desperate for help at any position. In March, Sean Payton told reporters that New Orleans was interested in free agent slot receiver Adam Humphries, but the price got too high. Payton clearly thinks that the Saints could use a middle-of-the-field threat for Drew Brees, but it's possible that recently signed tight end Jared Cook can fill that role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-card&quot;

Despite what the front office and Giants&rsquo; ownership may say, it&rsquo;s time for New York to find a replacement for Eli Manning. But QB is far from the team&rsquo;s only issue. Without Beckham there&rsquo;s a glaring hole at receiver, even after the team signed Golden Tate. The Giants upgraded at guard by trading for Kevin Zeitler, but they had to ship off their only reliable edge rusher to get him. Except for running back and guard, the Giants could reasonably go in any direction early in the draft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-card&quot; data-id=8&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-top-section&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;top-title&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;logo-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=&quot;

After Vikings linebacker Anthony Barr reneged on his verbal agreement with New York following a last-minute change of heart, the Jets&amp;mdash;now, and essentially every year since John Abraham left town in 2006&amp;mdash;need a no. 1 edge rusher. A trade with the Raiders for guard Kelechi Osemele filled a hole on the left side of their offensive line, but upgrades at center and right tackle remain necessary. Maccagnan could also target a top-tier cornerback to play opposite Trumaine Johnson. Despite lighting more money on fire than the guys from &lt;i&gt;Triple Frontier&lt;/i&gt;, the Jets could go several directions early in this draft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;list_inter&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;div class=&quot;inter-subtitle&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inter-title&quot;&gt; Should NFL Teams&lt;br/&gt; Tank for&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tua &amp; &lt;br/&gt;Trevor?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inter-byline&quot;&gt; BY Rodger Sherman &lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/nfldraft-theringer-com-cms/legacy/media/tua-interstitial-x-small.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/nfldraft-theringer-com-cms/legacy/media/tua-interstitial-x-small.png&quot; alt=&quot;Should NFL Teams Tank for Tua and Trevor?&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The two most pro-ready quarterbacks from college football last season are not in the 2019 NFL draft.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alabama&rsquo;s Tua Tagovailoa is the best QB prospect I&rsquo;ve ever seen. There is never a point during any play when he believes he cannot throw a touchdown&amp;mdash;and over time, I&rsquo;ve come to learn that with his outrageous arm, rare vision, and excellent mobility, he&rsquo;s capable of just that. Despite being a risk-taker, he didn&rsquo;t throw an interception until he already had 26 touchdown passes in the 2018 campaign. And he had the poise to win a national championship as a true freshman. There&rsquo;s just one problem for NFL teams: He isn&rsquo;t eligible to join the league until after his junior season, so they&rsquo;ll have to wait to draft him until 2020 at the earliest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To some scouts, Clemson&rsquo;s Trevor Lawrence (who beat Tagovailoa&rsquo;s Alabama team in January&rsquo;s national title game) is the best quarterback prospect they&rsquo;ve ever seen. He has prototypical size, a stronger arm than Tagovailoa, and oh yeah&amp;mdash;the poise to win a national championship as a true freshman. There&rsquo;s just one problem for NFL teams: He isn&rsquo;t eligible to join the league until after his junior season, so they&rsquo;ll have to wait to draft him until 2021 at the earliest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quarterbacks are more polished at younger ages than they&rsquo;ve ever been, and Tagovailoa and Lawrence are the leaders of this trend. They appeared ready for the NFL from the moment they stepped on campus, and as more QBs like them come along, we&rsquo;ll likely see a wave of pushback against the age restriction that prevents prospects from becoming draft-eligible until they&rsquo;re three years removed from high school. If both players were eligible now, Tagovailoa and Lawrence would almost certainly be the no. 1 and no. 2 picks in this year&rsquo;s draft. (Probably Lawrence first, then Tagovailoa.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allowing teams to draft freshmen would change the shape of the draft. With less time to evaluate players, there would be even wilder swings and misses than we&rsquo;re used to. But Lawrence and Tagovailoa would be worth it.

Trading for Brown and signing Tyrell Williams to a four-year, $44 million deal replenished the Raiders&rsquo; depth chart at receiver. Along the offensive line, Oakland should be set after signing tackle Trent Brown to a record-setting extension (although Gruden may look to add a guard after trading Kelechi Osemele to the Jets). Still, running back remains a pressing need. Marshawn Lynch and Doug Martin are both free agents, and the Raiders don&rsquo;t have a replacement on the roster that&rsquo;s capable of taking on a high-volume role. Defensively, the Raiders&rsquo; biggest problem is a lack of pass-rushing talent. After trading Khalil Mack to the Bears last year, Oakland finished with just 13 total sacks. Every other team in the NFL had at least 30. Second-year defensive end Arden Key may take a step forward this season, but the Raiders will need more than that to breathe life back into their pass rush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-card&quot;

Philadelphia has already added Malik Jackson, DeSean Jackson, Andrew Sendejo, and Vinny Curry this offseason while also retaining Ronald Darby on a one-year deal. Those contracts have fortified several different position groups. Philly&rsquo;s two most glaring holes entering free agency were at running back and linebacker; the team&rsquo;s recent trade for Bears bruiser Jordan Howard solves one of those issues. At linebacker, the Eagles lost starter Jordan Hicks to the Cardinals, and even after signing L.J. Fort to a modest three-year deal (which really amounts to a one-year deal with two team options), they could use more help in that area. Bringing Darby back is a short-term answer at corner, as he and Jalen Mills are set to be free agents next year. The Eagles should bring in some fresh blood at the position. And as tempting as it is to believe that 37-year-old left tackle Jason Peters is immortal, it&rsquo;s probably time for Philly to address its succession plan for the future Hall of Famer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-card&quot; data-id=15&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-top-section&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;top-title&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;logo-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=&quot; data-src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/nfldraft-theringer-com-cms/legacy/media/392px-Pittsburgh_Steelers_logo.svg.png&quot; class=&quot;team-logo&quot; alt=&quot;Pittsburgh Steelers Logo&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-name&quot; style=&quot;font-size:&quot;&gt;Pittsburgh Steelers&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-picks-needs-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-picks&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;team-picks-header&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;team-pick-number&quot;&gt;Top Picks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;team-pick-text&quot;&gt;How They Acquired It&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;team-picks-header&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;team-pick-number&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;team-pick-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pittsburgh&rsquo;s own first-round pick&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;team-picks-header&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;team-pick-number&quot;&gt;62&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;team-pick-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pittsburgh&rsquo;s own second-round pick&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;team-picks-header&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;team-pick-number&quot;&gt;66&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;team-pick-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the Raiders in 2019 trade that sent Antonio Brown to Oakland for a 2019 fifth-round pick&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;team-picks-header&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;team-pick-number&quot;&gt;83&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;team-pick-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pittsburgh&rsquo;s own third-round pick&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-needs&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-needs-header&quot;&gt;Team Needs&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;team-need&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Offensive tackle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;team-need&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cornerback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;team-need&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wide receiver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;team-need&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Edge rusher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-section player-count-&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-players-headline&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Friendly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Suggestions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nfldraft.theringer.com#codyford&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;team-player t no-silo&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-image-column&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=&quot; data-src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/nfldraft-theringer-com-cms/legacy/media/Cody-Ford_Getty.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cody Ford&quot; class=&quot;team-player-image&quot; style=&quot;transform: translate(, )&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-info-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-name&quot; style=&quot;font-size:&quot;&gt;Cody Ford&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-position&quot;&gt;Offensive tackle&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-school&quot;&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nfldraft.theringer.com#dkmetcalf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;team-player wr no-silo&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-image-column&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=&quot; data-src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/nfldraft-theringer-com-cms/legacy/media/DK-Metcalf_Getty.png&quot; alt=&quot;D.K.

Pittsburgh could also look to shore up spots that general manager Kevin Colbert temporarily filled with modest, under-the-radar free agency moves. Wide receiver Donte Moncrief signed a two-year deal this spring, but there&rsquo;s only $1.75 million in dead money on that contract after this season. Former Chiefs cornerback Steven Nelson inked a three-year deal with $7.5 million guaranteed, but with Joe Haden entering his age-30 season and the final year of his contract, Pittsburgh could be looking for more help at that spot. Former first-round pick Bud Dupree is also playing on the fifth-year option of his rookie deal, and it&rsquo;s possible that the Steelers look for another edge rusher who could play opposite T.J.

front office did a solid job adding talent at positions of need on relatively low-risk deals this offseason. San Francisco signed Jason Verrett to a one-year, $3.6 million deal, and if he can stay healthy (that&rsquo;s a big &ldquo;if&rdquo;), he and Richard Sherman would form an excellent cornerback duo. But concerns about Verrett&rsquo;s health and a lack of quality options on the outside may still motivate the Niners to take a cornerback fairly early in the draft. The team chose not to address its issues at safety in free agency, which almost certainly means it&rsquo;ll be looking for help at those spots in the first couple rounds. Coming into free agency, edge rusher might have been the Niners&rsquo; most pressing need, but trading a second-round pick for Dee Ford gives the 49ers a legitimate top-tier pass rusher. Unfortunately, they can&rsquo;t say the same about their receiver spots. Dante Pettis had a promising rookie year, and Marquise Goodwin was slowed by injuries in 2018. But it still feels like Kyle Shanahan&rsquo;s offense needs a true no. 1 receiver to play with breakout star George Kittle at tight end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-card&quot;

If Seattle chooses to decline right tackle Germain Ifedi&rsquo;s fifth-year option, he&rsquo;ll be a free agent after the season, and left guard Mike Iupati signed a one-year deal this spring, so he&rsquo;ll also be hitting the market in 2020.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, though, the Seahawks have their starting five up front on offense. But it&rsquo;s a different story on the defensive side of the ball. Seattle brought back pass rusher Frank Clark on the franchise tag this season, but Pete Carroll&rsquo;s defense could still use another edge rusher and another interior defensive lineman to pair with Jarran Reed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-card&quot;

Signing former Packers safety Kentrell Brice to a one-year deal isn&rsquo;t a long-term solution, and Brent Grimes&rsquo;s departure leaves Tampa Bay severely lacking in experience at cornerback. Both of the Bucs&rsquo; second-round picks last season were cornerbacks, and the hope is that Carlton Davis can improve in his second year. But M.J. Stewart has yet to find a role and could potentially get moved to safety this fall. Plus, Vernon Hargreaves has struggled, which means Tampa Bay likely won&rsquo;t pick up his fifth-year option. The interior of the defensive line could also use an upgrade in talent next to Gerald McCoy&amp;mdash;and also a plan for when the 31-year-old defensive tackle eventually moves on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-card&quot;

Elsewhere on the offense, the team signed slot man Adam Humphries to a deal in free agency. General manager Jon Robinson could still look for another outside receiver to pair with 2017 first-round pick Corey Davis. But with Davis, Humphries, Taywan Taylor, and the tight end pair of Jonnu Smith and Delanie Walker, he may not see pass catchers as a priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tennessee&rsquo;s needs on defense are a little easier to identify. The Titans could use another interior presence next to star tackle Jurrell Casey, and even after signing 37-year-old Cam Wake to a three-year deal, the defense could benefit from some more edge-rushing depth. All in all, though, Robinson has built a strong roster without many glaring deficiencies. The Titans&rsquo; most pressing question over the next couple drafts will be finding their long-term answer at quarterback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-card&quot; data-id=33&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-top-section&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;top-title&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;logo-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=&quot; data-src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/nfldraft-theringer-com-cms/legacy/media/454px-Washington_Redskins_logo.svg.png&quot; class=&quot;team-logo&quot; alt=&quot;Washington Redskins Logo&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-name&quot; style=&quot;font-size:&quot;&gt;Washington Redskins&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-picks-needs-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-picks&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;team-picks-header&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;team-pick-number&quot;&gt;Top Picks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;team-pick-text&quot;&gt;How They Acquired It&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;team-picks-header&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;team-pick-number&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;team-pick-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington's own first-round pick&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;team-picks-header&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;team-pick-number&quot;&gt;46&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;team-pick-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington's own second-round pick&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;team-picks-header&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;team-pick-number&quot;&gt;76&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;team-pick-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington's own third-round pick&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;team-picks-header&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;team-pick-number&quot;&gt;96&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;team-pick-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compensatory pick&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-needs&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-needs-header&quot;&gt;Team Needs&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;team-need&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cornerback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;team-need&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Safety&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;team-need&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Linebacker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;team-need&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wide receiver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;team-need&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Offensive lineman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;team-need&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Edge rusher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;team-need&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Quarterback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-section player-count-&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-players-headline&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Friendly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Suggestions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nfldraft.theringer.com#devinwhite&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;team-player no-silo&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-image-column&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=&quot; data-src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/nfldraft-theringer-com-cms/legacy/media/Devin-White_APImages.png&quot; alt=&quot;Devin White&quot; class=&quot;team-player-image&quot; style=&quot;transform: translate(, )&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-info-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-name&quot; style=&quot;font-size:&quot;&gt;Devin White&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-position&quot;&gt;Linebacker&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-school&quot;&gt;LSU&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nfldraft.theringer.com#dkmetcalf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;team-player wr no-silo&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-image-column&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;team-player-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=&quot; data-src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/nfldraft-theringer-com-cms/legacy/media/DK-Metcalf_Getty.png&quot; alt=&quot;D.K.

Case Keenum is a short-term stopgap at quarterback that covers Washington while Alex Smith recovers from a badly broken leg, but the team is still expected to take a QB early in the draft. Washington signed Landon Collins to a massive six-year, $84 million contract with nearly $45 million in guarantees, and it still could use another safety. Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie&rsquo;s return from a short retirement solves one cornerback problem, but Washington still needs another. And upgrades at linebacker aren&rsquo;t out of the question, either, which is why the Redskins were reportedly interested in clearing cap space for C.J. Mosley earlier this month. The former Ravens linebacker landed on the Jets with fellow free agent and former Redskins receiver Jamison Crowder. With Crowder gone, Washington is relying on Paul Richardson, disappointing Josh Doctson, and not much else at wide receiver. Outside of a few spots along the offensive and defensive line, pretty much any position will be in play for Washington in the draft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;";

He is a three-year starter who learned under former Eli and Peyton Manning tutor David Cutcliffe at Duke, and playing in an RPO-heavy offense, he displayed the ability to go through reads and throw with accuracy at the short and intermediate levels. Jones is very athletic, capable of running away from defenders if he finds some daylight, and rushed for 17 touchdowns in his college career.

He has the athleticism to carry running backs out of the backfield.<\/p>\n            <strong>Why He Could Rise<\/strong>\n            <p>Cashman has outstanding sideline-to-sideline speed and is an extremely reliable tackler.<\/p>\n            <strong>Why He Could Fall<\/strong>\n            <p>He\u2019s slightly undersized and may be limited to playing on the weak side in the NFL.<\/p>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"combine-results is-mobile\">\n            <h4 class=\"combine-h4\"><strong>Combine Results<\/strong><\/h4>\n                            <ul class=\"\">\n                                            <li>\n                            <span class=\"label\">40-yard dash time<\/span>\n                            <span class=\"value\">4.5<\/span>\n                        <\/li>\n                                            <li>\n                            <span class=\"label\">Short shuttle time<\/span>\n                            <span class=\"value\">4.12<\/span>\n                        <\/li>\n                                            <li>\n                            <span class=\"label\">3-cone drill time<\/span>\n                            <span class=\"value\">6.95<\/span>\n                        <\/li>\n                                            <li>\n                            <span class=\"label\">Broad jump<\/span>\n                            <span class=\"value\">124&#039;&#039;<\/span>\n                        <\/li>\n                                            <li>\n                            <span class=\"label\">Vertical jump<\/span>\n                            <span class=\"value\">37.5&#039;&#039;<\/span>\n                        <\/li>\n                                    <\/ul>\n            \n        <\/div>\n        <h6 class=\"more-ringer-coverage\">\n        <a href=\"\" class=\"color-theme\">SEE MORE RINGER COVERAGE<\/a>\n    <\/h6>\n    <div class=\"player-social\">\n        <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnfldraft.theringer.com%2Fshare%2Fblakecashman.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"facebook\">Share To Facebook<\/a>\n        <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnfldraft.theringer.com%23blakecashman&text=The%20Ringer%E2%80%99s%20All-Encompassing%20Two-Round%20NFL%20Mock%20Draft%20and%20Top-100%20Big%20Board\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"twitter\">Share To Twitter<\/a>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","combine_html":"<h4 class=\"combine-h4\"><strong>Combine Results<\/strong><\/h4>\n    <ul class=\"\">\n                    <li>\n                <span class=\"label\">40-yard dash time<\/span>\n                <span class=\"value\">4.5<\/span>\n            <\/li>\n                    <li>\n                <span class=\"label\">Short shuttle time<\/span>\n                <span class=\"value\">4.12<\/span>\n            <\/li>\n                    <li>\n                <span class=\"label\">3-cone drill time<\/span>\n                <span class=\"value\">6.95<\/span>\n            <\/li>\n                    <li>\n                <span class=\"label\">Broad jump<\/span>\n                <span class=\"value\">124&#039;&#039;<\/span>\n            <\/li>\n                    <li>\n                <span class=\"label\">Vertical jump<\/span>\n                <span class=\"value\">37.5&#039;&#039;<\/span>\n            <\/li>\n            <\/ul>\n","show_updated":false,"share_title":"Where does Blake Cashman land on The Ringer\u2018s 2019 NFL draft board?

He showed a nose for the ball for the Wolfpack, racking up 104 tackles&mdash;including 10 for a loss&mdash;plus three passes defensed and two forced fumbles in 2018. The former safety understands how routes develop in coverage and showed off excellent effective range and a smooth transition to trailing position to carry running backs or tight ends downfield. When lined up over the slot, he is physical at the line of scrimmage, jamming and rerouting pass catchers. He can slice through the line and finish as a blitzer, and notched 6.0 sacks last season.

He showed a nose for the ball for the Wolfpack, racking up 104 tackles&mdash;including 10 for a loss&mdash;plus three passes defensed and two forced fumbles in 2018. The former safety understands how routes develop in coverage and showed off excellent effective range and a smooth transition to trailing position to carry running backs or tight ends downfield. When lined up over the slot, he is physical at the line of scrimmage, jamming and rerouting pass catchers. He can slice through the line and finish as a blitzer, and notched 6.0 sacks last season. He has very good closing burst and tackle radius and the potential to play inside or outside in both 3-4 and 4-3 schemes. He takes on blocks with a far-too-upright technique, though, leaving him susceptible to getting knocked back or sealed out of the play too easily.

He\u2019s a very good athlete, with speed (4.66-second 40-yard dash), agility (6.89-second 3-cone), and explosiveness (a 36-inch vertical jump).

He\u2019s still new to his new position, but he\u2019s long, athletic, and silky smooth off the line of scrimmage. Lining up primarily in the slot, he drew on a limited route tree but showed the ability to make sharp cuts and gear down quickly to shake defenders.

Watt; he\u2019s not nearly as explosive as the three-time Defensive Player of the Year but does possess good first-step burst, pack plenty of power in his hands, and know how to use his length as leverage. Allen has to win early in his rush or he can get stalemated, and, while he\u2019s not consistently going to threaten the edge against pro tackles, he showed he can get to the quarterback with a repertoire of block-beating moves, including a strong swim move and powerful club-rip.

If you squint, the former Boston College standout looks a little like J.J. Watt; he\u2019s not nearly as explosive as the three-time Defensive Player of the Year but does possess good first-step burst, pack plenty of power in his hands, and know how to use his length as leverage. Allen has to win early in his rush or he can get stalemated, and, while he\u2019s not consistently going to threaten the edge against pro tackles, he showed he can get to the quarterback with a repertoire of block-beating moves, including a strong swim move and powerful club-rip. He\u2019s a dominant run defender and has notched 40.5 tackles for a loss in the past three seasons. His massive wingspan gives him a wide tackle radius and helps him stack linemen and shed blocks. He knocked down seven passes and blocked two kicks in 2018.

His draft stock is connected to where teams project him at the next level: Because of his top-tier athleticism, he has a high floor as a penetrating, gap-shooting three-technique defensive tackle, where his quick-twitch burst and power can be better utilized.<\/p>\n            <strong>Why He Could Rise<\/strong>\n            <p>Wren has elite athletic traits, massive size, and plenty of length.<\/p>\n            <strong>Why He Could Fall<\/strong>\n            <p>He lacked in production, grabbing just 3.0 career sacks, and needs work on his pass-rushing technique.<\/p>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"combine-results is-mobile\">\n            <h4 class=\"combine-h4\"><strong>Combine Results<\/strong><\/h4>\n                            <ul class=\"\">\n                                            <li>\n                            <span class=\"label\">Arm length<\/span>\n                            <span class=\"value\">33 7\/8&#039;&#039;<\/span>\n                        <\/li>\n                                            <li>\n                            <span class=\"label\">3-cone drill time<\/span>\n                            <span class=\"value\">7.65<\/span>\n                        <\/li>\n                                            <li>\n                            <span class=\"label\">Short shuttle time<\/span>\n                            <span class=\"value\">4.53<\/span>\n                        <\/li>\n                                            <li>\n                            <span class=\"label\">Broad jump<\/span>\n                            <span class=\"value\">118&#039;&#039;<\/span>\n                        <\/li>\n                                            <li>\n                            <span class=\"label\">Vertical jump<\/span>\n                            <span class=\"value\">32&#039;&#039;<\/span>\n                        <\/li>\n                                    <\/ul>\n            \n        <\/div>\n        <h6 class=\"more-ringer-coverage\">\n        <a href=\"\" class=\"color-theme\">SEE MORE RINGER COVERAGE<\/a>\n    <\/h6>\n    <div class=\"player-social\">\n        <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnfldraft.theringer.com%2Fshare%2Frenellwren.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"facebook\">Share To Facebook<\/a>\n        <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnfldraft.theringer.com%23renellwren&text=The%20Ringer%E2%80%99s%20All-Encompassing%20Two-Round%20NFL%20Mock%20Draft%20and%20Top-100%20Big%20Board\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"twitter\">Share To Twitter<\/a>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","combine_html":"<h4 class=\"combine-h4\"><strong>Combine Results<\/strong><\/h4>\n    <ul class=\"\">\n                    <li>\n                <span class=\"label\">Arm length<\/span>\n                <span class=\"value\">33 7\/8&#039;&#039;<\/span>\n            <\/li>\n                    <li>\n                <span class=\"label\">3-cone drill time<\/span>\n                <span class=\"value\">7.65<\/span>\n            <\/li>\n                    <li>\n                <span class=\"label\">Short shuttle time<\/span>\n                <span class=\"value\">4.53<\/span>\n            <\/li>\n                    <li>\n                <span class=\"label\">Broad jump<\/span>\n                <span class=\"value\">118&#039;&#039;<\/span>\n            <\/li>\n                    <li>\n                <span class=\"label\">Vertical jump<\/span>\n                <span class=\"value\">32&#039;&#039;<\/span>\n            <\/li>\n            <\/ul>\n","show_updated":false,"share_title":"Where does Renell Wren land on The Ringer\u2018s 2019 NFL draft board?

He is a dynamic punt and kick returner.<\/p>\n            <strong>Why He Could Rise<\/strong>\n            <p>Hardman has rare speed and is still just scratching the surface of his potential.<\/p>\n            <strong>Why He Could Fall<\/strong>\n            <p>He\u2019s still very raw, lacks size, has a small catch radius, and may be limited as a slot or gadget-type player at the next level.<\/p>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"combine-results is-mobile\">\n            <h4 class=\"combine-h4\"><strong>Combine Results<\/strong><\/h4>\n                            <ul class=\"\">\n                                            <li>\n                            <span class=\"label\">Hand size<\/span>\n                            <span class=\"value\">9&#039;&#039;<\/span>\n                        <\/li>\n                                            <li>\n                            <span class=\"label\">40-yard dash time<\/span>\n                            <span class=\"value\">4.33<\/span>\n                        <\/li>\n                                            <li>\n                            <span class=\"label\">Vertical jump<\/span>\n                            <span class=\"value\">36.5&#039;&#039;<\/span>\n                        <\/li>\n                                    <\/ul>\n            \n        <\/div>\n        <h6 class=\"more-ringer-coverage\">\n        <a href=\"\" class=\"color-theme\">SEE MORE RINGER COVERAGE<\/a>\n    <\/h6>\n    <div class=\"player-social\">\n        <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnfldraft.theringer.com%2Fshare%2Fmecolehardmanjr.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"facebook\">Share To Facebook<\/a>\n        <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnfldraft.theringer.com%23mecolehardmanjr&text=The%20Ringer%E2%80%99s%20All-Encompassing%20Two-Round%20NFL%20Mock%20Draft%20and%20Top-100%20Big%20Board\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"twitter\">Share To Twitter<\/a>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","combine_html":"<h4 class=\"combine-h4\"><strong>Combine Results<\/strong><\/h4>\n    <ul class=\"\">\n                    <li>\n                <span class=\"label\">Hand size<\/span>\n                <span class=\"value\">9&#039;&#039;<\/span>\n            <\/li>\n                    <li>\n                <span class=\"label\">40-yard dash time<\/span>\n                <span class=\"value\">4.33<\/span>\n            <\/li>\n                    <li>\n                <span class=\"label\">Vertical jump<\/span>\n                <span class=\"value\">36.5&#039;&#039;<\/span>\n            <\/li>\n            <\/ul>\n","show_updated":false,"share_title":"Where does Mecole Hardman Jr. land on The Ringer\u2018s 2019 NFL draft board?

He\u2019s still new to his new position, but he\u2019s long, athletic, and silky smooth off the line of scrimmage. Lining up primarily in the slot, he drew on a limited route tree but showed the ability to make sharp cuts and gear down quickly to shake defenders.
